"32","HSERTT Weight Cable Pulley System Gym","Wish I ordered this YEARS ago!","Ken","I wish I had ordered this for my home gym years ago! The overall quality of this is fantastic. I was really surprised. Doesn't feel cheap at all. And set up is super easy. I simply hook it up to my pull up bar in the door frame. Takes about 20 seconds. Pile the weights on and go. I'm using standard plates and the loading pin measures about 13"" tall. Plenty of room to stack a decent amount of weight on.For the last several years I've been using barbells and dumbbells. Basic stuff. But wow, it's so nice to have access to such a wide range of new exercises now!The only exercises that don't quite feel right are the cable flyes (when the pulleys are attached to a pull up bar) and bicep curls.With cable flyes in a gym, the pulleys are directly at your sides, which creates a constant tension on your chest muscles no matter where your arms are in the range of motion. When this set up is attached to your pull up bar at home, you have to step forward which moves the pulleys are behind you. So once your arms are pointed straight out in front of you, the tension is taken off your chest muscles and placed directly onto your shoulders and triceps. So at best you get the same stimulation you'd get from a dumbbell chest fly with the same limitations of that movement.For bicep curls, it just doesn't feel right when the loading pin is attached to the pulley and allowed to glide freely on the cable (like they show in the pictures). So an easy fix for this is to simply not use the cables. Load up the loading pin with your weights, attach the rope or straight bar to it, and do your curls that way. No cable needed. You get a lot more tension on your biceps that way than if you try to let the pulley glide freely on the cable.Otherwise, all of the tricep, shoulder, back and ab movements feel FANTASTIC with this set up. SERTT offers two different options for this set. One is a little cheaper and comes with fewer attachments and cables. I highly encourage you to spend the extra $10 on this one for the extra cables, attachments, and pulley. I'm constantly discovering new exercises to do and I wouldn't be able to do them without the extra equipment that comes with this $65 option.Highly, highly recommend this!","Reviewed in the United States on 3 December 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Then I attached one of the straps from this set onto the bottom of the opposite of my rack. Voila. I can do glute kickbacks, side leg extensions for inner thighs and ham curls with weights which I could only do with bands before. I will be checking out to see what I can figure out for quads. The other straps I attached to the top back and front of my rack for when I want to do upper body stuff.

"82","HSERTT Weight Cable Pulley System Gym","Wish I ordered this YEARS ago!","Ken","I wish I had ordered this for my home gym years ago! The overall quality of this is fantastic. I was really surprised. Doesn't feel cheap at all. And set up is super easy. I simply hook it up to my pull up bar in the door frame. Takes about 20 seconds. Pile the weights on and go. I'm using standard plates and the loading pin measures about 13"" tall. Plenty of room to stack a decent amount of weight on.For the last several years I've been using barbells and dumbbells. Basic stuff. But wow, it's so nice to have access to such a wide range of new exercises now!The only exercises that don't quite feel right are the cable flyes (when the pulleys are attached to a pull up bar) and bicep curls.With cable flyes in a gym, the pulleys are directly at your sides, which creates a constant tension on your chest muscles no matter where your arms are in the range of motion. When this set up is attached to your pull up bar at home, you have to step forward which moves the pulleys are behind you. So once your arms are pointed straight out in front of you, the tension is taken off your chest muscles and placed directly onto your shoulders and triceps. So at best you get the same stimulation you'd get from a dumbbell chest fly with the same limitations of that movement.For bicep curls, it just doesn't feel right when the loading pin is attached to the pulley and allowed to glide freely on the cable (like they show in the pictures). So an easy fix for this is to simply not use the cables. Load up the loading pin with your weights, attach the rope or straight bar to it, and do your curls that way. No cable needed. You get a lot more tension on your biceps that way than if you try to let the pulley glide freely on the cable.Otherwise, all of the tricep, shoulder, back and ab movements feel FANTASTIC with this set up. SERTT offers two different options for this set. One is a little cheaper and comes with fewer attachments and cables. I highly encourage you to spend the extra $10 on this one for the extra cables, attachments, and pulley. I'm constantly discovering new exercises to do and I wouldn't be able to do them without the extra equipment that comes with this $65 option.Highly, highly recommend this!","Reviewed in the United States on 3 December 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I can do glute kickbacks, side leg extensions for inner thighs and ham curls with weights which I could only do with bands before. I will be checking out to see what I can figure out for quads.

But wow, it's so nice to have access to such a wide range of new exercises now!The only exercises that don't quite feel right are the cable flyes (when the pulleys are attached to a pull up bar) and bicep curls.With cable flyes in a gym, the pulleys are directly at your sides, which creates a constant tension on your chest muscles no matter where your arms are in the range of motion. When this set up is attached to your pull up bar at home, you have to step forward which moves the pulleys are behind you. So once your arms are pointed straight out in front of you, the tension is taken off your chest muscles and placed directly onto your shoulders and triceps. So at best you get the same stimulation you'd get from a dumbbell chest fly with the same limitations of that movement.For bicep curls, it just doesn't feel right when the loading pin is attached to the pulley and allowed to glide freely on the cable (like they show in the pictures). So an easy fix for this is to simply not use the cables. Load up the loading pin with your weights, attach the rope or straight bar to it, and do your curls that way. No cable needed. You get a lot more tension on your biceps that way than if you try to let the pulley glide freely on the cable.Otherwise, all of the tricep, shoulder, back and ab movements feel FANTASTIC with this set up. SERTT offers two different options for this set. One is a little cheaper and comes with fewer attachments and cables. I highly encourage you to spend the extra $10 on this one for the extra cables, attachments, and pulley. I'm constantly discovering new exercises to do and I wouldn't be able to do them without the extra equipment that comes with this $65 option.Highly, highly recommend this!","Reviewed in the United States on 3 December 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Then I attached one of the straps from this set onto the bottom of the opposite of my rack. Voila. I can do glute kickbacks, side leg extensions for inner thighs and ham curls with weights which I could only do with bands before. I will be checking out to see what I can figure out for quads. The other straps I attached to the top back and front of my rack for when I want to do upper body stuff. The chains and extra pulley's are great.","Reviewed in Canada on 15 October 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"256","Fat Gripz Pro",NA,"Tim","I bought the Fat Gripz Pro and the Fat Gripz Extreme. I will review both here, because they had pretty surprising use cases for me.An important thing to note is that I have quite large hands, not freakish, but 24 cm from pinky to thumb, and about 19 cm from middle finger tip to wrist. This latter number is important because my hands will comfortably wrap around the Fat Gripz Pro with my fingers and thumbs just touching and honestly I find they can make certain lifts, like bench press (I know this is not their intended use), MORE comfortable. But, for when I want to be uncomfortable, I use the Extremes.I remember agonizing over if I should buy the Extremes as well as the Pros given a lot of reviews, by much bigger and stronger folks than me, said the Extremes were pretty hardcore and you should start with the Pros and work your way up. I am very enthusiastic about improving my grip, in part because I have ulnar nerve damage in both my arms which has weakened my grip (for reference, my grip fails around ~150kg deadlift), so I figured I'd buy both and work my way up to the Extremes. In reality, I felt pretty comfortable with the Extremes straight away and they're exclusively what I use for grip/forearm training, while the Pros I use for warm ups, grip ""drop sets"", or for push exercises where I want something comfortable in my palm.The only negative thing I have to say about both the Pros and the Extremes is that I wish they were longer (wider?) as they are about the same width as my palm, so I have to be quite precise with where I place them.TL;DR: if you have big hands and are tossing up between the Extremes and the Pros, don't be discouraged by people telling you not to get the Extremes straight away. They're slightly smaller than a tin can, so if the idea of curling a 20kg can of baked beans is okay to you then I'd say just go for it.","Reviewed in Australia on 2 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Multiple scrapes and dings in the bar itself, along with the rubber decal being deformed3. Both bar ends had significant rattle/movement. During the return process communication with the seller was good, however they insisted that the bar was new and the rattle was normal.

I ordered dips bar which somehow took almost one month to arrive. I would say worst shipping experience I ever had. Except that when the parcel arrived the box was damaged as you can see from the picture (I still kept it because I wanted the product and could not wait another month to get the replacement). unfortunately not only box but the product was also partially damaged. you can see few pictures of defects which it had.Positive side is that it is really easy to assemble and feels like it can handle the weight. I am around 85 kg and used the bar few times already and had no issues so far.If you are lucky and get proper shipping then it worth the money.","Reviewed in Germany on 4 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"407","Prosource Fit Dip Stand Station","overall pretty good","The Dude 🎳","If I'd had this dip station as a kid, I wouldn't have broken my arm from enthusiastically swinging between the backs of the dining room chairs and the back of the couch like a tiny hyperactive monkey after school.Needless to say I'm an adult now (kind of) and learned my lesson well about the questionable stability of dining chairs for the sake of acrobatics back then.I bought the ""Lite"" Dipping Station version. Despite the listed weight capacity of up to 400lbs, I wasn't sure if this would be sturdy enough to handle my heavy body weight so I really hestitated between this one and other ones, but I've had it for about 3 months now; it's still trucking same as it did on day one.This is a good one. It doesn't adjust up/down like some stations, but instead is basically two heavy duty bars connected to the bottom parts. I think that's what makes it so solid. It's very few pieces, and a lot of good heavy soldering where they connect. I'm glad I got this one instead of the kind that might ""adjust down"" on me unexpectedly while I'm using it. It's weird that an item named ""lite"" seems better to me than one named ""pro""..? but... whatever. They're completely different styles and this one's a way better design for what I wanted and was looking for. Nice and solid, no up and down adjustables relying on little pins. Just solid.The dipping bars were pretty easy to put together and came with the only tool it needed (for putting in the screws.) It was easier than putting together a metal bedframe; it took maybe 5 minutes including reading the directions; you just have to pay attention to where the holes are on the lower part (like where the connecting bar goes. between the two) Otherwise it'll take an extra minute as you flip it.The connecting bar keeps the two dipping bars from skidding on smooth flooring, so I'd recommend putting it on, especially if you're a heavier weight, even though it's not necessarily needed. It keeps the bars together so you don't have to worry about it sliding.The cushion ""handles"" on the station are actually comfortable. No weird smell or any ""stickiness"" from them although it's gotten hot this summer. I didn't know at first if I'd like them, but they're good, and so far have been very durable.Getting it has made it SO much easier for me to do a little exercise more frequently without the exhaustion of setting up anything or planning to exercise, or the pressure of doing it for a set period of time. Once it's put togther, there's nothing to adjust, prep, or set up. It's just there: you can do it as you walk from your room to whereever or back, or not, and it takes literally no extra mental or physical effort or good intentions or planning. You either do or you don't, because it's right there and on the way. Stick it in front of a doorway and it's great. It's accessible. You don't have to take it out or put it away. And it barely takes any space. (Unlike my slant bench... that doesn't quite fit the room when set up... that I have to pull out to even use, and takes up a bunch of horizontal real estate I could use.)There are some things that when you buy them, they help you with your life, and this has been one of them, so thanks, company. You did a good job, and it's appreciated. I needed it.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 July 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"430","Prosource Fit Dip Stand Station","Pleased. Solid design. Good investment.","ana","Love it! I read all the reviews before purchasing, and although most of the reviews were great, the odd one got me doubting whether this was a solid product or not. Now that I have received it and put it together, I love it. Take your time putting it together and hand tighten it lossley until you can line it up on the floor and make sure everything is squared before final tightening with the Allen wrench, then put the safety bar in. It moves a little when weight is not on it, but is totally solid when you put body weight on it. The vid in the review that shows a bolt not tightening, you'll notice he hasn't put the safety bar in, which has the thread that will actually make it tighten. So no worries on that. If you're a super big guy wanting to do handstands on the fully extended height, be aware that you are probably pushing it to the max, and if you're surprised it is not the most stable, well, duh. I'm a 5'7 female, and before I attempt to do a handstand on these bars four feet in the air, I might attache some straps to provide more stability, just in case, which is just a good fail safe, unless you have perfect balance. If I wanted to do a handstand and be wobbly AF, I would simply take off the exterior rubber caps to the feet and add an additional steel pipe, which I appreciate is easy to do. And I'd put it up against a wall if I was afraid of tipping forward or backward. In my opinion this is a solid design that you could further adapt if you wanted to push the parameters of its capacity. Bad reviews are; the product may have a manufacturer defect ( it can happen), but most likely people not knowing how to put it together right, probably due to using the Allen wrench right off the bat, which could cause the parts to tighten on uneven threads, and make it wobbly. So many options to choose from or spend more money on, I got mine, and was totally pleased that I chose this one. Relieved.","Reviewed in Canada on 5 October 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Mi pareja tampoco puede cerrarlas completamente, pero al tener la mano más grande, no está tan incómodo.

Aunque es verdad que nunca se debe de apretar de más las tuercas porque estás pueden barrerse con el tiempo o romperse.Deben de apretar lo justoTambién comento los que publican que las barras son gruesas son una incomodidad .Aconsejo que ejerciten primero los antebrazos para tener fuerza en ellas ya que nunca podrán realizar dichos ejercicios si no tienen fuerza en las manos para realizar inclusive dominadas y lo fondos .Lo otro es que solo mide 1.50 cm de alto  que es lo maximo que llega las barras lo que si es verdad no lo adquieran las personas altas de 1.70cm para arriba ya que se golpearan las rodillas solo es para personas enanas como yo que soy de 166cm.que es perfecto pues obvio que no toco el suelo con mis rodillas del suelo y si insisten en adquirirlo. bueno tendrán que subirlos con un par de libros para compensar la altura que necesitan para realizar dichos ejercicios como el hefesto y fondos.","Reviewed in Mexico on 25 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"450","Prosource Fit Dip Stand Station","Bent and unsteady, but workable","パンチョ","I bought this to do pull ups in a lying down position to strengthen my back after an injury. It’s not easy to adjust the height so that’s a draw back (it’s screwed together), but I won’t be changing heights until I increase in strength which will take some time. My chief complaint is that one of the bars sits flat, no unsteadiness while the other bar is uneven and shakes. I put a shim underneath to even it out so I made it work for me. It’s a pain to take it apart, put it back and return for another that potentially will have the same manufacturing problem, so I’m just dealing with it. Other than that it seems solid and does the job. That’s my experience so far.","Reviewed in the United States on 7 November 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"453","Sunny Health & Fitness Twisting Stair Stepper Machine","Amazing product","Antonio s.","Antes de comprar el aparato he leido miles de reseñas de esta y otras maquinas parecidas, mi conclusion despues de 6 meses es el siguiente.Es una maquina que funciona con dos hidraulicos lo cual significa que estos tienen una vida util diferente al resto de la maquina, pero estos pueden ser reparados o remplazados, aunque por el pequeño precio que tiene la maquina en si no creo que valga la pena, para que estos hidraulicos funcionen bien y tengan una vida util larga es importante mantenerlos bien, lo mas importante es evitar que estos lleguen a calentarse mucho o esten en funcionamiento mucho tiempo a una temperatura alta, por dentro tienen un aceite especial que es la que se calienta y pierde sus propiedades, la mejor forma para que no se caliente es o utilizarlos en tramos cortos de unos 15 min y dejarlos enfriar o utilizar un sistema de enfriamiento para que no se caliente tanto, un sistema simple consistiria en un ventilador a la altura del suelo o ventilacion cruzada; ya sea cerca de una puerta al exterior o aire acondicionado en la estancia. En invierno o en un clima frio seria suficiente para que no se calentara tanto, aun asi sienpre es mejor usarlos periodos cortos 15 o 20 min y dejar que se enfrie. Si dejamos que se caliente mucho y lo hacemos de forma prolongada lo que sucedera es que el haceide pierda sus propiedades mas rapido de lo normal y el hidraulio deje de funcionar. Estos consejos es para que dure mas tiempo de ll que puede durar sin mantenimiento que ya es vastante, calculo que usandola cada dia 30 min su vida seria de 2 años como mucho.Teniendo en cuenta lo anterior evitaremos que nos salgan ruidos antes de lo normal.Y una vez dicho esto sobre la maquina para hacer ejercicios es muy buena, es una maquina muy basica y muy funcional, simula que subamos escalones, de echo notaremos presion en los musculos por encima de las rodillas tal cual como cuando subimos escaleras de forma continuada, un ejercicio por cierto muy completo ya que si se ejecuta bien se ejercita casi todo el cuerpo.He leido comentarios de que hay a personas  que no se les suve el nivel de pulsaciones, pues me cuesta mucho creer que sea asi, yo cuando llevo mas de 5 minutos noto que me cuesta respirar y que mi corazon aumenta sus latidos.Soy una prueba de que la maquina quema calorias pues a 800 calorias a lo largo de dia que uso la maquina en este periodo he perdido vasta te peso claro esta que intentando comer sano pero no deja de ser una maquina que puede remplazar una caminara.La maquina a los meses empieza a hacer ruido de sus hidraulicos pero no es muy molestoos ni nada malo es algo normal no deja de ser una maquina con un sistema mecanico, como el resto de maquinas que tambien lo hacen ya sea bicicletas cintas etc...Si quieres perder peso y o hacer ejercicio en casa esta es una maquina calidad precio efectiva.","Reviewed in Spain on 25 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"463","Sunny Health & Fitness Twisting Stair Stepper Machine","I'm pleasantly surprised!","Daniel Torres","Originally, I was browsing for a treadmill, but I really wanted something that would develop stronger muscles for walking uphill or step climbing (a few months ago I walked the length of the Grand Canyon,  rim to rim, and I want to stay in shape for the next trip). When I read the reviews for this piece of equipment, I was still slightly undecided about it, but I chose to take the risk.I've only had it for three days. I am 5' 11"", 205 lbs., and 69 years old.I had no problems putting it together; the base comes already assembled. The only assembly needed is with the vertical upright. I was very careful with the assembly instructions, and it took about 30 minutes to set up. But I went very slow. The equipment is made in China (imagine that!), so the instructions lack proper English, but they're manageable. The front of the base has a knob that will adjust the tension. The stepper makes very little noise; it's hardly noticeable.The base is approximately 18"" by 18"".Also, there's nothing to plug in.Before ordering, I thought that the handle would be too low for me, but it's the perfect height. I have mine set at optimum height (same as in the picture in the ad).Initially, I only took about 50 steps, and I was already breathing hard, so I got some rest. I felt that my leg muscles were receiving the exercise that I was looking for. Three days later, I'm doing 200 steps and then stopping. The air cylinders get pretty warm. I check the stepper every time I get off of it, looking for damage or anything loose. So far, everything is fine.I've also discovered an added bonus: I can place my hands on the bottom horizontal part of the handle (grip tighly) and slightly lean forward while stepping. As I take the steps, I slightly push up on my upper body with my arms, causing my biceps, triceps, and chest muscles to also get a workout, along with my legs. I just have to be careful not to lean forward too much, so I won't fall frontwards. So be very careful with this.As mentioned above, I've only had this equipment for three days. But so far, I am pleasantly surprised. Turns out that it was exactly what I wanted. And the price is very reasonable.UPDATE: I've had this stepper for almost 8 weeks. I have worked up to 3,000 steps a day. However, when I get near 700 steps, it begins to squeal. I've used different lubricating sprays, but the noise is still annoying. I finally found something that works: I place a small fan on the floor, directly in front of the red tension knob of the stepper. This cools down the bottom area, and that eliminates the noise.I'm still satisfied with the purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"465","Sunny Health & Fitness Twisting Stair Stepper Machine","Works well and easy to put together","Nat","Assembly of this is not as difficult as putting together an IKEA product, and they give you all the components to do so.  I was hesitant to buy after reading some of the reviews of the stepper failing after a few months. If it does, I will update the review, but it’s been a week and it works well.  One caveat: if you are a Canadian customer, you aren’t covered by the warranty.  The main handlebar and adjustment knob did not thread together, so I contacted Sunny customer support via email.  They always responded within 24 to 48 hours.  They shipped me replacement parts for free, but I did have to pay for shipping.  That was $55 CAD.  However, they told me that Amazon would likely cover that cost within 90 days of original purchase date.  I contacted Amazon support by phone, and they did refund me back on my original form of payment the shipping cost (without needing the invoice).  But, you only have 90 days to do that.  Even though two of the parts did not fit together (handlebars), I could use the machine until the replacement was sent, and it was an easy process to do it.  It would not deter me from buying another Sunny product in the future. Overall, I’m happy with the purchase.","Reviewed in Canada on 22 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"471","Sunny Health & Fitness Twisting Stair Stepper Machine","Where has this been all my life?","Marick","This is the most amazing little stepper machine. Manual instructions never make sense to me, but once I figured out where all the bolts went it was a breeze to assemble. I'm about 135 pounds/5'8"" tall and this machine has no problem remaining sturdy with about a 10 minute workout. I need core exercise or I suffer from sciatica real bad. I've only been using this stepper for a few days and already it has strengthened my lower back, and even sorted out a recurring issue I've had with my right knee for over 30 years. It does a great job tightening the muscles and is easy to use. I think with the ""twisting"" motion it somehow realigns the skeletal system, aiding in reducing aches and pains. I'd highly recommend this stepper to anyone who's been thinking about it, but not sure if they should spend the money on it or not. Worst case scenario, return it. Otherwise I think most people will be very happy with this equipment.","Reviewed in Canada on 23 February 2023","4.3 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"492","Sunny Health & Fitness Twisting Stair Stepper Machine","Great little machine with ONE small challenge","Info Seeker","I love this stepper!  The one ""complaint"" (and it is really just a precaution):  If you are weak (or perhaps elderly), do NOT depend on leaning on the handlebars to get on the machine - get one foot on first, then the handlebars will help you mount the machine; otherwise, it easily tilts and could throw you to the floor.  It is small, compact, easy to move and gives me a great workout.  I have a Cubii (can I say that?) and enjoy using it to keep my circulation strong, but it did nothing to help me build strength in my thighs to navigate stairs.  Perhaps they could add some weight on the ""front"" of the machine to counter-balance it, but then it wouldn't be as easy to move around.  I'd buy it again.  So many people don't understand how important it is as you age to keep the thigh muscles strong enough to lift you out of chairs, climb stairs, etc.  Having to pull (or push) yourself up a flight of stairs or out of a recliner with arm/shoulder muscles alone is asking for trouble - too easy to break or dislocate something - then what are you going to do?","Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

No concerns at all about them coming off when I'm working out. Not much else to say, really. If you need straps like these and you don't want to spend a lot, you should probably get them.One small word of caution though: they are not heavily padded, so if you weigh much, you may find these uncomfortable. I'm fairly light, so it's not a big issue, but for folks putting a lot of pressure on their arms, these may become painful.","Reviewed in the United States on 28 October 2014","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"511","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","Simple and Awesome","Ben S.","The pandemic taught me how to get a good workout at home, and even now that we're out of it the habit remains. This pull up bar is surprisingly durable and supports my weight without a problem (230lb), and it allows me to get some back work in whenever I want. I use only the parallel grips, as the regular grip is a little too narrow for my shoulder width, but that's what I prefer anyhow and I have no concerns about them breaking.I will say, it may be beneficial to put a tennis ball or something protective on each end of the bar that presses against the door frame, and it is starting to leave a visible indentation. But, that is also variable depending on the weight of the person using the bar and how hard it presses into the frame.","Reviewed in the United States on 6 December 2023","4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"515","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","A few adjustments as it did not fit the door frame.","Fulrcum","Seems sturdy. Easy to assemble, tad there are 4 screws and it comes with a wrench. And the metal tubes are pretty solid. When assembled it was too wide for the door way. I took off the rubber end caps and cut off 1.5 inches off each side and then put the rubber caps on again. Fits perfectly. I also wanted it higher so on the backside of the door frame I secured a piece of wood that boosts the bar up about 2.25 inches. This will also help with the weight (I’m 220lbs) on the moulding around the door. The only thing that puzzles me is that everything is metal but the bar that rests horizontally on the back of the door frame. It’s plastic. Seems somewhat durable, but I wonder if that will be the thing that might break. We will see.***Update (3 weeks later): solid and functional. I’ve done about 900 chin ups/pull ups on it, and it flexes, but it is sturdy and solid. The foam pads have ripped a bit, but I just use hockey tape and wrap the handles. No other issues.

"519","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","Mine came a little scuffed","Tadeo Eduardo","Mine was slated to come in 3 weeks but arrived only about 1/2 week after. Not a deal breaker, but when it finally arrived the package was crumpled, the bubble wrap was browning and the ziploc containing the screws was completely ripped. The tiny washers basically dropped out asap and I almost lost them. Foam was already dented in some areas, harmless but looks bad. Then during assembly I found out that the bottom screws were perfect but the top ones had too much leeway even with the given washers.I fixed it by putting extra 6.8mm washers to tighten the top area (as pictured). Unfortunately my door frame didn't suit the design of the bar and it hangs awkwardly at a 45 degree angle somewhat dangerously - at least it's still usable because of the horizontal bar being shorter than the doorway (2nd pic).As for the positives the metal is pretty sturdy, cushioning is just ok. My packaging looked like ancient warehouse goods but the product itself is fine. Ideally you want your door frame to hang about 2.4cm off a wall to get the bar to stand straight as intended, but even if it doesn't (like mine) it can still be used. Just exercise caution and don't swing on it.TL;DR Product seems fine, but delivery and condition leaves some to be desired.

"524","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","Extremely easy to take down and put up","Miles","The item was delivered without any additional boxes (so everyone who saw the the box knew it was a workout bar). It took 5 minutes (10 minutes max) to set the bar up and put onto the door. So far, there is no damage on the door and it is super easy to set up and take down. My husband is 6'0, 165lbs and I'm 4'11, 105lbs and both of us use the bar. We have toddlers running around the home so we constantly need the doors closed, which means we take the bar down daily and put it back up at night when they are sleeping. It is super easy to take on and off. I'm super happy we bought it. The only con to the bar is how bulky it is since we live in a small space and we constantly need the doors closed during the daytime. Aside from that, I would 100% recommend the product.","Reviewed in Canada on 24 August 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"525","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","Geniale Alternative zu Klemm-Türrecks","Kai","In meiner alten Wohnung hatte ich ein Türreck, welches man zwischen den Türrahmen verkeilt. Die Gumminoppen haben abgefärbt und die stetige Spannung ihre Spuren am Rahmen hinterlassen. Außerdem hat das Türreck doch auf Dauer auch gestört.Der Iron Gym ist eine geniale Alternative, sofern man einen Türrahmen im Haus hat, dessen Maße passen. Meiner hat eine Tiefe von 18,5 cm, das Gewicht hängt so allerdings schon an den Rundstangen, der Plastikteil liegt nicht mehr auf der Wand auf. Dennoch hält es mein Gewicht von 75 kg ohne Probleme. Also erst Ausmessen, dann Bestellen!Lieferung: Wie immer top und zügig durch Amazon.Verpackung: Alle Einzelteile sind sicher in Schaumstoff verpackt, Kleinteile getrennt. Im Lieferumfang enthalten sind der Iron Gym (bestehend aus 4 Stangen plus der Plastik/Schaumstoff Auflage), ein kleiner Ernähtungs- und Trainings-Ratgeber, ein Sicherheitskeil und die Sicherheits-Befestigung. Letztere sind beide optional und verhindern, dass der Iron Gym sich beim Training aushängt. Der Keil wird einfach in den Türrahmen gesteckt, die Befestigung wird mit Dübeln in der Wand verankert. Doch wie gesagt, beides optional, ich trainiere ohne.Qualität: Ich war überrascht, wie robust die Konstruktion wirkt. Die Schaumstoffpolster halten einiges aus, die Metallstangen sind allesamt solide und ohne scharfe Kanten. Die Montage ist eine Sache von Sekunden - statt dem beigepackten Schlüssel würde ich für die Schrauben aber eigenes Werkzeug empfehlen. Die Schrauben jedoch nicht zu fest ziehen!Handling: Klimmzüge müssen natürlich mit angewinkelten Beinen durchgeführt werden. Die Griffe sind angenehm und rutschfest, 3 Griffstellungen sind möglich. Auch für Liegestütze (2 Griffmöglichkeiten) und Sit-Ups ist das Gerät klasse. Für Dips ist ein Stuhl praktischer als dieses Gerät, da zu tief.Meine volle Kaufempfehlung. Sollte sich auf lange Zeit meine Meinung zum Iron Gym ändern, werde ich die Rezession natürlich dementsprechend aktualisieren.","Reviewed in Germany on 19 October 2012","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"539","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","Good Addition to an Iron Gym, Especially If You Like Velcro","Brett","Bought to use with my Iron Gym (duh) so that I could do hanging ab exercises.  They do work well enough, but I sometimes question if they will hold me (the closures on them are velcro - and while the contact area for the velcro pads is substantial, I still hesitated at first to put my full weight on them.  That said, they do hold (I'm about 175lbs) and don't seem to be straining at all but I'll knock off half a start for using velcro over a different hanging solution (not to mention the ripping sound of parting that much velcro when you remove them).They do enable me to do the hanging ab crunches I purchased them for, but not the oblique movements - this is not due to a fault in the product itself per se, but more just a fact of how it works - since you're hanging under the Iron Gym, you're in the middle of a door frame.  This means that side to side movements will be limited by the width of the door frame itself.  So half a star lost here.Still overall, a good product if you already own the Iron Gym (or similar) and want to expand your use of it.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 August 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"541","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","Very few flaws—well built","Anon","I purchased this for my twelve year old daughter, who wanted to strengthen her arms. Therefore, I never planned on doing any “heavy-duty” workouts with it or such, so I can’t properly rate it in regards to range of motion as I have no experience in that department, but it seems to be sturdy enough for dips, pushups, etc from what I can tell. In regards to the set-up, the instructions were a bit confusing, but there are many Youtube videos online easily guiding you through the process, so that was no problem.Everything was very well packaged and nothing was damaged-everything was in bags, that were indicated.Now in regards to the sturdiness. I’ll be honest, at first, I was a bit worried that it would fall. We hung it on my daughter’s doorframe, so it would be a pull-up bar. After pulling on it quite a few times to test the durability, we tried it. I believe the weight limit is something around 250lbs or so. I feel as if this bar would be sturdy enough, but I am not positive.Last two things—the only big flaw I noticed was that since we hung ours on the doorframe, we must be really careful to not push up when  when doing pull-ups as that would cause it to fall from the doorframe and for the person to injure themselves. Lastly, I read some reviews mentioning that the individual’s doorframe began to bend and the bar caused problems in the doorframe. Since I haven’t had it very long, and since the primary user of the bar is only around 80 lbs, I haven’t seen any issues in the doorframe, but only time will tell.Overall, I recommend this bar for recreational purposes, and just to get a good workout in at home. It serves our purpose and is very helpful.","Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2020","4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"550","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","NOT IRON GYM","RedFormula1","I had read the reviews before so I knew that the product was a FAKE. Surprisingly the product wasn't as bad as reviewed. It is a Door Gym not and Iron Gym, also I think the items are second hand, due to poor conditions.  I think the seller should be more honest about the product they are selling as it is deception.The item was poorly packaged (just in a large jiffy bag), and the main box was also damaged.It did arrive before estimated date. The item smells and feels new (just a 'knock-off' version). However the damaged instructions suggest the product maybe second hand. Some reviews have reported having difficulty fitting the Door Gym together. I didn't have this problem, all screws were present and fit the frame (just).The item fits inside my door frame and hold my weight. The pads are comfortable (one is a bit loose) and i feel safe using the product.  The main bar may prove to be weak as it is in two sections with nothing (not even a clips inside the bars) holding them together so your weight is resting on the plastic bar at the top. However, this is nothing a bit of duck tape can't strengthen.  , Box and Instructions damaged but efficient seller.Yes, the seller lied, deceived and has used 'fake' pictures of the item hey are selling, something you expect from eBay NOT Amazon.  The material is cheaper than the Iron Gym but as you are only a few feet from the ground I can't see any health risks. Also, it costs just over £10, what do you expect?! If you want amazing quality good then your going to have to pay top prices. There is a reason Gym's charge high monthly rates, and it is because their equipment is expensive! I'm afraid there is not such thing as a bargain anymore only expensive imitation and copy cat products.It suited my needs as it will not be over used but if you are a heavy male/female or intend to use this product intensely I suggest you purchase the real thing.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 December 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
