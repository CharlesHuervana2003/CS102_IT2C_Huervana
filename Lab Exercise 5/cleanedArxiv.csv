"2","learning-augmented algorithms with explicit predictors","marek elias, haim kaplan, yishay mansour, shay moran","machine learning","recent advances in algorithmic design show how to utilize predictions obtained by machine learning models from past and present data. these approaches have demonstrated an enhancement in performance when the predictions are accurate, while also ensuring robustness by providing worst-case guarantees when predictions fail. in this paper we focus on online problems; prior research in this context was focused on a paradigm where the predictor is pre-trained on past data and then used as a black box (to get the predictions it was trained for). in contrast, in this work, we unpack the predictor and integrate the learning problem it gives rise for within the algorithmic challenge. in particular we allow the predictor to learn as it receives larger parts of the input, with the ultimate goal of designing online learning algorithms specifically tailored for the algorithmic task at hand. adopting this perspective, we focus on a number of fundamental problems, including caching and scheduling, which have been well-studied in the black-box setting. for each of the problems we consider, we introduce new algorithms that take advantage of explicit learning algorithms which we carefully design towards optimizing the overall performance. we demonstrate the potential of our approach by deriving performance bounds which improve over those established in previous work.",2024-03-12
"3","new perspectives in online contract design: heterogeneous, homogeneous, non-myopic agents and team production","shiliang zuo","computer science and game theory","this work studies the repeated principal-agent problem from an online learning perspective. the principal's goal is to learn the optimal contract that maximizes her utility through repeated interactions, without prior knowledge of the agent's type (i.e., the agent's cost and production functions).
i study three different settings when the principal contracts with a $\textit{single}$ agent each round: 1. the agents are heterogeneous; 2. the agents are homogenous; 3. the principal interacts with the same agent and the agent is non-myopic. i present different approaches and techniques for designing learning algorithms in each setting. for heterogeneous agent types, i identify a condition that allows the problem to be reduced to lipschitz bandits directly. for identical agents, i give a polynomial sample complexity scheme to learn the optimal contract based on inverse game theory. for strategic non-myopic agents, i design a low strategic-regret mechanism. also, i identify a connection between linear contracts and posted-price auctions, showing the two can be reduced to one another, and give a regret lower bound on learning the optimal linear contract based on this observation.
i also study a $\textit{team production}$ model. i identify a condition under which the principal's learning problem can be reformulated as solving a family of convex programs, thereby showing the optimal contract can be found efficiently.",2024-03-11
"4","the cram method for efficient simultaneous learning and evaluation","zeyang jia, kosuke imai, michael lingzhi li","machine learning","we introduce the ""cram"" method, a general and efficient approach to simultaneous learning and evaluation using a generic machine learning (ml) algorithm. in a single pass of batched data, the proposed method repeatedly trains an ml algorithm and tests its empirical performance. because it utilizes the entire sample for both learning and evaluation, cramming is significantly more data-efficient than sample-splitting. the cram method also naturally accommodates online learning algorithms, making its implementation computationally efficient. to demonstrate the power of the cram method, we consider the standard policy learning setting where cramming is applied to the same data to both develop an individualized treatment rule (itr) and estimate the average outcome that would result if the learned itr were to be deployed. we show that under a minimal set of assumptions, the resulting crammed evaluation estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. while our asymptotic results require a relatively weak stabilization condition of ml algorithm, we develop a simple, generic method that can be used with any policy learning algorithm to satisfy this condition. our extensive simulation studies show that, when compared to sample-splitting, cramming reduces the evaluation standard error by more than 40% while improving the performance of learned policy. we also apply the cram method to a randomized clinical trial to demonstrate its applicability to real-world problems. finally, we briefly discuss future extensions of the cram method to other learning and evaluation settings.",2024-03-11
"5","human-exoskeleton interaction portrait","mohammad shushtari, julia foellmer, arash arami","robotics","human-robot physical interaction contains crucial information for optimizing user experience, enhancing robot performance, and objectively assessing user adaptation. this study introduces a new method to evaluate human-robot co-adaptation in lower limb exoskeletons by analyzing muscle activity and interaction torque as a two-dimensional random variable. we introduce the interaction portrait (ip), which visualizes this variable's distribution in polar coordinates. we applied this metric to compare a recent torque controller (htc) based on kinematic state feedback and a novel feedforward controller (amtc) with online learning, proposed herein, against a time-based controller (tbc) during treadmill walking at varying speeds. compared to tbc, both htc and amtc significantly lower users' normalized oxygen uptake, suggesting enhanced user-exoskeleton coordination. ip analysis reveals this improvement stems from two distinct co-adaptation strategies, unidentifiable by traditional muscle activity or interaction torque analyses alone. htc encourages users to yield control to the exoskeleton, decreasing muscular effort but increasing interaction torque, as the exoskeleton compensates for user dynamics. conversely, amtc promotes user engagement through increased muscular effort and reduced interaction torques, aligning it more closely with rehabilitation and gait training applications. ip phase evolution provides insight into each user's interaction strategy development, showcasing ip analysis's potential in comparing and designing novel controllers to optimize human-robot interaction in wearable robots.",2024-03-11
"6","monotone individual fairness","yahav bechavod","machine learning","we revisit the problem of online learning with individual fairness, where an online learner strives to maximize predictive accuracy while ensuring that similar individuals are treated similarly. we first extend the frameworks of gillen et al. (2018); bechavod et al. (2020), which rely on feedback from human auditors regarding fairness violations, as we consider auditing schemes that are capable of aggregating feedback from any number of auditors, using a rich class we term monotone aggregation functions. we then prove a characterization for such auditing schemes, practically reducing the analysis of auditing for individual fairness by multiple auditors to that of auditing by (instance-specific) single auditors. using our generalized framework, we present an oracle-efficient algorithm achieving an upper bound frontier of $(\mathcal{o}(t^{1/2+2b}),\mathcal{o}(t^{3/4-b}))$ respectively for regret, number of fairness violations, for $0\leq b \leq 1/4$. we then study an online classification setting where label feedback is available for positively-predicted individuals only, and present an oracle-efficient algorithm achieving an upper bound frontier of $(\mathcal{o}(t^{2/3+2b}),\mathcal{o}(t^{5/6-b}))$ for regret, number of fairness violations, for $0\leq b \leq 1/6$. in both settings, our algorithms improve on the best known bounds for oracle-efficient algorithms. furthermore, our algorithms offer significant improvements in computational efficiency, greatly reducing the number of required calls to an (offline) optimization oracle per round, to $\tilde{\mathcal{o}}(\alpha^{-2})$ in the full information setting, and $\tilde{\mathcal{o}}(\alpha^{-2} + k^2t^{1/3})$ in the partial information setting, where $\alpha$ is the sensitivity for reporting fairness violations, and $k$ is the number of individuals in a round.",2024-03-11
"7","automatic design optimization of preference-based subjective evaluation with online learning in crowdsourcing environment","yusuke yasuda, tomoki toda","human-computer interaction","a preference-based subjective evaluation is a key method for evaluating generative media reliably. however, its huge combinations of pairs prohibit it from being applied to large-scale evaluation using crowdsourcing. to address this issue, we propose an automatic optimization method for preference-based subjective evaluation in terms of pair combination selections and allocation of evaluation volumes with online learning in a crowdsourcing environment. we use a preference-based online learning method based on a sorting algorithm to identify the total order of evaluation targets with minimum sample volumes. our online learning algorithm supports parallel and asynchronous execution under fixed-budget conditions required for crowdsourcing. our experiment on preference-based subjective evaluation of synthetic speech shows that our method successfully optimizes the test by reducing pair combinations from 351 to 83 and allocating optimal evaluation volumes for each pair ranging from 30 to 663 without compromising evaluation accuracies and wasting budget allocations.",2024-03-10

"9","online adaptation of language models with a memory of amortized contexts","jihoon tack, jaehyung kim, eric mitchell, jinwoo shin, yee whye teh, jonathan richard schwarz","machine learning","due to the rapid generation and dissemination of information, large language models (llms) quickly run out of date despite enormous development costs. due to this crucial need to keep models updated, online learning has emerged as a critical necessity when utilizing llms for real-world applications. however, given the ever-expanding corpus of unseen documents and the large parameter space of modern llms, efficient adaptation is essential. to address these challenges, we propose memory of amortized contexts (mac), an efficient and effective online adaptation framework for llms with strong knowledge retention. we propose an amortized feature extraction and memory-augmentation approach to compress and extract information from new documents into compact modulations stored in a memory bank. when answering questions, our model attends to and extracts relevant knowledge from this memory bank. to learn informative modulations in an efficient manner, we utilize amortization-based meta-learning, which substitutes the optimization process with a single forward pass of the encoder. subsequently, we learn to choose from and aggregate selected documents into a single modulation by conditioning on the question, allowing us to adapt a frozen language model during test time without requiring further gradient updates. our experiment demonstrates the superiority of mac in multiple aspects, including online adaptation performance, time, and memory efficiency. code is available at: this https url.",2024-03-07
"10","why online reinforcement learning is causal","oliver schulte, pascal poupart","machine learning","reinforcement learning (rl) and causal modelling naturally complement each other. the goal of causal modelling is to predict the effects of interventions in an environment, while the goal of reinforcement learning is to select interventions that maximize the rewards the agent receives from the environment. reinforcement learning includes the two most powerful sources of information for estimating causal relationships: temporal ordering and the ability to act on an environment. this paper examines which reinforcement learning settings we can expect to benefit from causal modelling, and how. in online learning, the agent has the ability to interact directly with their environment, and learn from exploring it. our main argument is that in online learning, conditional probabilities are causal, and therefore offline rl is the setting where causal learning has the most potential to make a difference. essentially, the reason is that when an agent learns from their {\em own} experience, there are no unobserved confounders that influence both the agent's own exploratory actions and the rewards they receive. our paper formalizes this argument. for offline rl, where an agent may and typically does learn from the experience of {\em others}, we describe previous and new methods for leveraging a causal model, including support for counterfactual queries.",2024-03-07

"13","to spend or to gain: online learning in repeated karma auctions","damien berriaud, ezzat elokda, devansh jalota, emilio frazzoli, marco pavone, florian dörfler","computer science and game theory","recent years have seen a surge of artificial currency-based mechanisms in contexts where monetary instruments are deemed unfair or inappropriate, e.g., in allocating food donations to food banks, course seats to students, and, more recently, even for traffic congestion management. yet the applicability of these mechanisms remains limited in repeated auction settings, as it is challenging for users to learn how to bid an artificial currency that has no value outside the auctions. indeed, users must jointly learn the value of the currency in addition to how to spend it optimally. in this work, we study the problem of learning to bid in two prominent classes of artificial currency auctions: those in which currency, which users spend to obtain public resources, is only issued at the beginning of a finite period; and those where, in addition to the initial currency endowment, currency payments are redistributed to users at each time step. in the latter class, the currency has been referred to as karma, since users do not only spend karma to obtain public resources but also gain karma for yielding them. in both classes, we propose a simple learning strategy, called adaptive karma pacing, and show that this strategy a) is asymptotically optimal for a single user bidding against competing bids drawn from a stationary distribution; b) leads to convergent learning dynamics when all users adopt it; and c) constitutes an approximate nash equilibrium as the number of users grows. our results require a novel analysis in comparison to adaptive pacing strategies in monetary auctions, since we depart from the classical assumption that the currency has known value outside the auctions, and moreover consider that the currency is both spent and gained in the class of auctions with redistribution.",2024-03-06
"14","online learning with unknown constraints","karthik sridharan, seung won wilson yoo","machine learning","we consider the problem of online learning where the sequence of actions played by the learner must adhere to an unknown safety constraint at every round. the goal is to minimize regret with respect to the best safe action in hindsight while simultaneously satisfying the safety constraint with high probability on each round. we provide a general meta-algorithm that leverages an online regression oracle to estimate the unknown safety constraint, and converts the predictions of an online learning oracle to predictions that adhere to the unknown safety constraint. on the theoretical side, our algorithm's regret can be bounded by the regret of the online regression and online learning oracles, the eluder dimension of the model class containing the unknown safety constraint, and a novel complexity measure that captures the difficulty of safe learning. we complement our result with an asymptotic lower bound that shows that the aforementioned complexity measure is necessary. when the constraints are linear, we instantiate our result to provide a concrete algorithm with $\sqrt{t}$ regret using a scaling transformation that balances optimistic exploration with pessimistic constraint satisfaction.",2024-03-06
"15","learning adversarial mdps with stochastic hard constraints","francesco emanuele stradi, matteo castiglioni, alberto marchesi, nicola gatti","machine learning","we study online learning problems in constrained markov decision processes (cmdps) with adversarial losses and stochastic hard constraints. we consider two different scenarios. in the first one, we address general cmdps, where we design an algorithm that attains sublinear regret and cumulative positive constraints violation. in the second scenario, under the mild assumption that a policy strictly satisfying the constraints exists and is known to the learner, we design an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret while ensuring that the constraints are satisfied at every episode with high probability. to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study cmdps involving both adversarial losses and hard constraints. indeed, previous works either focus on much weaker soft constraints--allowing for positive violation to cancel out negative ones--or are restricted to stochastic losses. thus, our algorithms can deal with general non-stationary environments subject to requirements much stricter than those manageable with state-of-the-art algorithms. this enables their adoption in a much wider range of real-world applications, ranging from autonomous driving to online advertising and recommender systems.",2024-03-06

"17","online learning of human constraints from feedback in shared autonomy","shibei zhu, tran nguyen le, samuel kaski, ville kyrki","robotics","real-time collaboration with humans poses challenges due to the different behavior patterns of humans resulting from diverse physical constraints. existing works typically focus on learning safety constraints for collaboration, or how to divide and distribute the subtasks between the participating agents to carry out the main task. in contrast, we propose to learn a human constraints model that, in addition, considers the diverse behaviors of different human operators. we consider a type of collaboration in a shared-autonomy fashion, where both a human operator and an assistive robot act simultaneously in the same task space that affects each other's actions. the task of the assistive agent is to augment the skill of humans to perform a shared task by supporting humans as much as possible, both in terms of reducing the workload and minimizing the discomfort for the human operator. therefore, we propose an augmentative assistant agent capable of learning and adapting to human physical constraints, aligning its actions with the ergonomic preferences and limitations of the human operator.",2024-03-05
"18","mirror descent algorithms with nearly dimension-independent rates for differentially-private stochastic saddle-point problems","tomás gonzález, cristóbal guzmán, courtney paquette","optimization and control","we study the problem of differentially-private (dp) stochastic (convex-concave) saddle-points in the polyhedral setting. we propose $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-dp algorithms based on stochastic mirror descent that attain nearly dimension-independent convergence rates for the expected duality gap, a type of guarantee that was known before only for bilinear objectives. for convex-concave and first-order-smooth stochastic objectives, our algorithms attain a rate of $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + (\log(d)^{3/2}/[n\varepsilon])^{1/3}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem and $n$ the dataset size. under an additional second-order-smoothness assumption, we improve the rate on the expected gap to $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + (\log(d)^{3/2}/[n\varepsilon])^{2/5}$. under this additional assumption, we also show, by using bias-reduced gradient estimators, that the duality gap is bounded by $\log(d)/\sqrt{n} + \log(d)/[n\varepsilon]^{1/2}$ with constant success probability. this result provides evidence of the near-optimality of the approach. finally, we show that combining our methods with acceleration techniques from online learning leads to the first algorithm for dp stochastic convex optimization in the polyhedral setting that is not based on frank-wolfe methods. for convex and first-order-smooth stochastic objectives, our algorithms attain an excess risk of $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + \log(d)^{7/10}/[n\varepsilon]^{2/5}$, and when additionally assuming second-order-smoothness, we improve the rate to $\sqrt{\log(d)/n} + \log(d)/\sqrt{n\varepsilon}$. instrumental to all of these results are various extensions of the classical maurey sparsification lemma, which may be of independent interest.",2024-03-05

"26","lower bounds for differential privacy under continual observation and online threshold queries","edith cohen, xin lyu, jelani nelson, tamás sarlós, uri stemmer","cryptography and security","one of the most basic problems for studying the ""price of privacy over time"" is the so called private counter problem, introduced by dwork et al. (2010) and chan et al. (2010). in this problem, we aim to track the number of events that occur over time, while hiding the existence of every single event. more specifically, in every time step $t\in[t]$ we learn (in an online fashion) that $\delta_t\geq 0$ new events have occurred, and must respond with an estimate $n_t\approx\sum_{j=1}^t \delta_j$. the privacy requirement is that all of the outputs together, across all time steps, satisfy event level differential privacy. the main question here is how our error needs to depend on the total number of time steps $t$ and the total number of events $n$. dwork et al. (2015) showed an upper bound of $o\left(\log(t)+\log^2(n)\right)$, and henzinger et al. (2023) showed a lower bound of $\omega\left(\min\{\log n, \log t\}\right)$. we show a new lower bound of $\omega\left(\min\{n,\log t\}\right)$, which is tight w.r.t. the dependence on $t$, and is tight in the sparse case where $\log^2 n=o(\log t)$. our lower bound has the following implications:
$\bullet$ we show that our lower bound extends to the ""online thresholds problem"", where the goal is to privately answer many ""quantile queries"" when these queries are presented one-by-one. this resolves an open question of bun et al. (2017).

in this paper, we introduce a model to capture the human-ai interplay in content moderation. the algorithm observes contextual information for incoming posts, makes classification and admission decisions, and schedules posts for human review. only admitted posts receive human reviews on their harmfulness. these reviews help educate the machine-learning algorithms but are delayed due to congestion in the human review system. the classical learning-theoretic way to capture this human-ai interplay is via the framework of learning to defer, where the algorithm has the option to defer a classification task to humans for a fixed cost and immediately receive feedback. our model contributes to this literature by introducing congestion in the human review system. moreover, unlike work on online learning with delayed feedback where the delay in the feedback is exogenous to the algorithm's decisions, the delay in our model is endogenous to both the admission and the scheduling decisions.
we propose a near-optimal learning algorithm that carefully balances the classification loss from a selectively sampled dataset, the idiosyncratic loss of non-reviewed posts, and the delay loss of having congestion in the human review system. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first result for online learning in contextual queueing systems and hence our analytical framework may be of independent interest.",2024-02-19

"57","on the distance from calibration in sequential prediction","mingda qiao, letian zheng","machine learning","we study a sequential binary prediction setting where the forecaster is evaluated in terms of the calibration distance, which is defined as the $l_1$ distance between the predicted values and the set of predictions that are perfectly calibrated in hindsight. this is analogous to a calibration measure recently proposed by błasiok, gopalan, hu and nakkiran (stoc 2023) for the offline setting. the calibration distance is a natural and intuitive measure of deviation from perfect calibration, and satisfies a lipschitz continuity property which does not hold for many popular calibration measures, such as the $l_1$ calibration error and its variants.
we prove that there is a forecasting algorithm that achieves an $o(\sqrt{t})$ calibration distance in expectation on an adversarially chosen sequence of $t$ binary outcomes. at the core of this upper bound is a structural result showing that the calibration distance is accurately approximated by the lower calibration distance, which is a continuous relaxation of the former. we then show that an $o(\sqrt{t})$ lower calibration distance can be achieved via a simple minimax argument and a reduction to online learning on a lipschitz class.
on the lower bound side, an $\omega(t^{1/3})$ calibration distance is shown to be unavoidable, even when the adversary outputs a sequence of independent random bits, and has an additional ability to early stop (i.e., to stop producing random bits and output the same bit in the remaining steps). interestingly, without this early stopping, the forecaster can achieve a much smaller calibration distance of $\mathrm{polylog}(t)$.",2024-02-12

in this work, we provide theoretical insights for a recently proposed learning paradigm, nash learning from human feedback (nlhf), which considered a general preference model and formulated the alignment process as a game between two competitive llms. the learning objective is to find a policy that consistently generates responses preferred over any competing policy while staying close to the initial model. the objective is defined as the nash equilibrium (ne) of the kl-regularized preference model. we aim to make the first attempt to study the theoretical learnability of the kl-regularized nlhf by considering both offline and online settings. for the offline learning from a pre-collected dataset, we propose algorithms that are efficient under suitable coverage conditions of the dataset. for batch online learning from iterative interactions with a preference oracle, our proposed algorithm enjoys a finite sample guarantee under the structural condition of the underlying preference model. our results connect the new nlhf paradigm with traditional rl theory, and validate the potential of reward-model-free learning under general preference.",2024-02-11
