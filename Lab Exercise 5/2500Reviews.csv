"32","HSERTT Weight Cable Pulley System Gym","Wish I ordered this YEARS ago!","Ken","I wish I had ordered this for my home gym years ago! The overall quality of this is fantastic. I was really surprised. Doesn't feel cheap at all. And set up is super easy. I simply hook it up to my pull up bar in the door frame. Takes about 20 seconds. Pile the weights on and go. I'm using standard plates and the loading pin measures about 13"" tall. Plenty of room to stack a decent amount of weight on.For the last several years I've been using barbells and dumbbells. Basic stuff. But wow, it's so nice to have access to such a wide range of new exercises now!The only exercises that don't quite feel right are the cable flyes (when the pulleys are attached to a pull up bar) and bicep curls.With cable flyes in a gym, the pulleys are directly at your sides, which creates a constant tension on your chest muscles no matter where your arms are in the range of motion. When this set up is attached to your pull up bar at home, you have to step forward which moves the pulleys are behind you. So once your arms are pointed straight out in front of you, the tension is taken off your chest muscles and placed directly onto your shoulders and triceps. So at best you get the same stimulation you'd get from a dumbbell chest fly with the same limitations of that movement.For bicep curls, it just doesn't feel right when the loading pin is attached to the pulley and allowed to glide freely on the cable (like they show in the pictures). So an easy fix for this is to simply not use the cables. Load up the loading pin with your weights, attach the rope or straight bar to it, and do your curls that way. No cable needed. You get a lot more tension on your biceps that way than if you try to let the pulley glide freely on the cable.Otherwise, all of the tricep, shoulder, back and ab movements feel FANTASTIC with this set up. SERTT offers two different options for this set. One is a little cheaper and comes with fewer attachments and cables. I highly encourage you to spend the extra $10 on this one for the extra cables, attachments, and pulley. I'm constantly discovering new exercises to do and I wouldn't be able to do them without the extra equipment that comes with this $65 option.Highly, highly recommend this!","Reviewed in the United States on 3 December 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Then I attached one of the straps from this set onto the bottom of the opposite of my rack. Voila. I can do glute kickbacks, side leg extensions for inner thighs and ham curls with weights which I could only do with bands before. I will be checking out to see what I can figure out for quads. The other straps I attached to the top back and front of my rack for when I want to do upper body stuff.

"82","HSERTT Weight Cable Pulley System Gym","Wish I ordered this YEARS ago!","Ken","I wish I had ordered this for my home gym years ago! The overall quality of this is fantastic. I was really surprised. Doesn't feel cheap at all. And set up is super easy. I simply hook it up to my pull up bar in the door frame. Takes about 20 seconds. Pile the weights on and go. I'm using standard plates and the loading pin measures about 13"" tall. Plenty of room to stack a decent amount of weight on.For the last several years I've been using barbells and dumbbells. Basic stuff. But wow, it's so nice to have access to such a wide range of new exercises now!The only exercises that don't quite feel right are the cable flyes (when the pulleys are attached to a pull up bar) and bicep curls.With cable flyes in a gym, the pulleys are directly at your sides, which creates a constant tension on your chest muscles no matter where your arms are in the range of motion. When this set up is attached to your pull up bar at home, you have to step forward which moves the pulleys are behind you. So once your arms are pointed straight out in front of you, the tension is taken off your chest muscles and placed directly onto your shoulders and triceps. So at best you get the same stimulation you'd get from a dumbbell chest fly with the same limitations of that movement.For bicep curls, it just doesn't feel right when the loading pin is attached to the pulley and allowed to glide freely on the cable (like they show in the pictures). So an easy fix for this is to simply not use the cables. Load up the loading pin with your weights, attach the rope or straight bar to it, and do your curls that way. No cable needed. You get a lot more tension on your biceps that way than if you try to let the pulley glide freely on the cable.Otherwise, all of the tricep, shoulder, back and ab movements feel FANTASTIC with this set up. SERTT offers two different options for this set. One is a little cheaper and comes with fewer attachments and cables. I highly encourage you to spend the extra $10 on this one for the extra cables, attachments, and pulley. I'm constantly discovering new exercises to do and I wouldn't be able to do them without the extra equipment that comes with this $65 option.Highly, highly recommend this!","Reviewed in the United States on 3 December 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I can do glute kickbacks, side leg extensions for inner thighs and ham curls with weights which I could only do with bands before. I will be checking out to see what I can figure out for quads.

But wow, it's so nice to have access to such a wide range of new exercises now!The only exercises that don't quite feel right are the cable flyes (when the pulleys are attached to a pull up bar) and bicep curls.With cable flyes in a gym, the pulleys are directly at your sides, which creates a constant tension on your chest muscles no matter where your arms are in the range of motion. When this set up is attached to your pull up bar at home, you have to step forward which moves the pulleys are behind you. So once your arms are pointed straight out in front of you, the tension is taken off your chest muscles and placed directly onto your shoulders and triceps. So at best you get the same stimulation you'd get from a dumbbell chest fly with the same limitations of that movement.For bicep curls, it just doesn't feel right when the loading pin is attached to the pulley and allowed to glide freely on the cable (like they show in the pictures). So an easy fix for this is to simply not use the cables. Load up the loading pin with your weights, attach the rope or straight bar to it, and do your curls that way. No cable needed. You get a lot more tension on your biceps that way than if you try to let the pulley glide freely on the cable.Otherwise, all of the tricep, shoulder, back and ab movements feel FANTASTIC with this set up. SERTT offers two different options for this set. One is a little cheaper and comes with fewer attachments and cables. I highly encourage you to spend the extra $10 on this one for the extra cables, attachments, and pulley. I'm constantly discovering new exercises to do and I wouldn't be able to do them without the extra equipment that comes with this $65 option.Highly, highly recommend this!","Reviewed in the United States on 3 December 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Then I attached one of the straps from this set onto the bottom of the opposite of my rack. Voila. I can do glute kickbacks, side leg extensions for inner thighs and ham curls with weights which I could only do with bands before. I will be checking out to see what I can figure out for quads. The other straps I attached to the top back and front of my rack for when I want to do upper body stuff. The chains and extra pulley's are great.","Reviewed in Canada on 15 October 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"256","Fat Gripz Pro",NA,"Tim","I bought the Fat Gripz Pro and the Fat Gripz Extreme. I will review both here, because they had pretty surprising use cases for me.An important thing to note is that I have quite large hands, not freakish, but 24 cm from pinky to thumb, and about 19 cm from middle finger tip to wrist. This latter number is important because my hands will comfortably wrap around the Fat Gripz Pro with my fingers and thumbs just touching and honestly I find they can make certain lifts, like bench press (I know this is not their intended use), MORE comfortable. But, for when I want to be uncomfortable, I use the Extremes.I remember agonizing over if I should buy the Extremes as well as the Pros given a lot of reviews, by much bigger and stronger folks than me, said the Extremes were pretty hardcore and you should start with the Pros and work your way up. I am very enthusiastic about improving my grip, in part because I have ulnar nerve damage in both my arms which has weakened my grip (for reference, my grip fails around ~150kg deadlift), so I figured I'd buy both and work my way up to the Extremes. In reality, I felt pretty comfortable with the Extremes straight away and they're exclusively what I use for grip/forearm training, while the Pros I use for warm ups, grip ""drop sets"", or for push exercises where I want something comfortable in my palm.The only negative thing I have to say about both the Pros and the Extremes is that I wish they were longer (wider?) as they are about the same width as my palm, so I have to be quite precise with where I place them.TL;DR: if you have big hands and are tossing up between the Extremes and the Pros, don't be discouraged by people telling you not to get the Extremes straight away. They're slightly smaller than a tin can, so if the idea of curling a 20kg can of baked beans is okay to you then I'd say just go for it.","Reviewed in Australia on 2 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Multiple scrapes and dings in the bar itself, along with the rubber decal being deformed3. Both bar ends had significant rattle/movement. During the return process communication with the seller was good, however they insisted that the bar was new and the rattle was normal.

I ordered dips bar which somehow took almost one month to arrive. I would say worst shipping experience I ever had. Except that when the parcel arrived the box was damaged as you can see from the picture (I still kept it because I wanted the product and could not wait another month to get the replacement). unfortunately not only box but the product was also partially damaged. you can see few pictures of defects which it had.Positive side is that it is really easy to assemble and feels like it can handle the weight. I am around 85 kg and used the bar few times already and had no issues so far.If you are lucky and get proper shipping then it worth the money.","Reviewed in Germany on 4 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"407","Prosource Fit Dip Stand Station","overall pretty good","The Dude 🎳","If I'd had this dip station as a kid, I wouldn't have broken my arm from enthusiastically swinging between the backs of the dining room chairs and the back of the couch like a tiny hyperactive monkey after school.Needless to say I'm an adult now (kind of) and learned my lesson well about the questionable stability of dining chairs for the sake of acrobatics back then.I bought the ""Lite"" Dipping Station version. Despite the listed weight capacity of up to 400lbs, I wasn't sure if this would be sturdy enough to handle my heavy body weight so I really hestitated between this one and other ones, but I've had it for about 3 months now; it's still trucking same as it did on day one.This is a good one. It doesn't adjust up/down like some stations, but instead is basically two heavy duty bars connected to the bottom parts. I think that's what makes it so solid. It's very few pieces, and a lot of good heavy soldering where they connect. I'm glad I got this one instead of the kind that might ""adjust down"" on me unexpectedly while I'm using it. It's weird that an item named ""lite"" seems better to me than one named ""pro""..? but... whatever. They're completely different styles and this one's a way better design for what I wanted and was looking for. Nice and solid, no up and down adjustables relying on little pins. Just solid.The dipping bars were pretty easy to put together and came with the only tool it needed (for putting in the screws.) It was easier than putting together a metal bedframe; it took maybe 5 minutes including reading the directions; you just have to pay attention to where the holes are on the lower part (like where the connecting bar goes. between the two) Otherwise it'll take an extra minute as you flip it.The connecting bar keeps the two dipping bars from skidding on smooth flooring, so I'd recommend putting it on, especially if you're a heavier weight, even though it's not necessarily needed. It keeps the bars together so you don't have to worry about it sliding.The cushion ""handles"" on the station are actually comfortable. No weird smell or any ""stickiness"" from them although it's gotten hot this summer. I didn't know at first if I'd like them, but they're good, and so far have been very durable.Getting it has made it SO much easier for me to do a little exercise more frequently without the exhaustion of setting up anything or planning to exercise, or the pressure of doing it for a set period of time. Once it's put togther, there's nothing to adjust, prep, or set up. It's just there: you can do it as you walk from your room to whereever or back, or not, and it takes literally no extra mental or physical effort or good intentions or planning. You either do or you don't, because it's right there and on the way. Stick it in front of a doorway and it's great. It's accessible. You don't have to take it out or put it away. And it barely takes any space. (Unlike my slant bench... that doesn't quite fit the room when set up... that I have to pull out to even use, and takes up a bunch of horizontal real estate I could use.)There are some things that when you buy them, they help you with your life, and this has been one of them, so thanks, company. You did a good job, and it's appreciated. I needed it.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 July 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"430","Prosource Fit Dip Stand Station","Pleased. Solid design. Good investment.","ana","Love it! I read all the reviews before purchasing, and although most of the reviews were great, the odd one got me doubting whether this was a solid product or not. Now that I have received it and put it together, I love it. Take your time putting it together and hand tighten it lossley until you can line it up on the floor and make sure everything is squared before final tightening with the Allen wrench, then put the safety bar in. It moves a little when weight is not on it, but is totally solid when you put body weight on it. The vid in the review that shows a bolt not tightening, you'll notice he hasn't put the safety bar in, which has the thread that will actually make it tighten. So no worries on that. If you're a super big guy wanting to do handstands on the fully extended height, be aware that you are probably pushing it to the max, and if you're surprised it is not the most stable, well, duh. I'm a 5'7 female, and before I attempt to do a handstand on these bars four feet in the air, I might attache some straps to provide more stability, just in case, which is just a good fail safe, unless you have perfect balance. If I wanted to do a handstand and be wobbly AF, I would simply take off the exterior rubber caps to the feet and add an additional steel pipe, which I appreciate is easy to do. And I'd put it up against a wall if I was afraid of tipping forward or backward. In my opinion this is a solid design that you could further adapt if you wanted to push the parameters of its capacity. Bad reviews are; the product may have a manufacturer defect ( it can happen), but most likely people not knowing how to put it together right, probably due to using the Allen wrench right off the bat, which could cause the parts to tighten on uneven threads, and make it wobbly. So many options to choose from or spend more money on, I got mine, and was totally pleased that I chose this one. Relieved.","Reviewed in Canada on 5 October 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Mi pareja tampoco puede cerrarlas completamente, pero al tener la mano más grande, no está tan incómodo.

Aunque es verdad que nunca se debe de apretar de más las tuercas porque estás pueden barrerse con el tiempo o romperse.Deben de apretar lo justoTambién comento los que publican que las barras son gruesas son una incomodidad .Aconsejo que ejerciten primero los antebrazos para tener fuerza en ellas ya que nunca podrán realizar dichos ejercicios si no tienen fuerza en las manos para realizar inclusive dominadas y lo fondos .Lo otro es que solo mide 1.50 cm de alto  que es lo maximo que llega las barras lo que si es verdad no lo adquieran las personas altas de 1.70cm para arriba ya que se golpearan las rodillas solo es para personas enanas como yo que soy de 166cm.que es perfecto pues obvio que no toco el suelo con mis rodillas del suelo y si insisten en adquirirlo. bueno tendrán que subirlos con un par de libros para compensar la altura que necesitan para realizar dichos ejercicios como el hefesto y fondos.","Reviewed in Mexico on 25 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"450","Prosource Fit Dip Stand Station","Bent and unsteady, but workable","パンチョ","I bought this to do pull ups in a lying down position to strengthen my back after an injury. It’s not easy to adjust the height so that’s a draw back (it’s screwed together), but I won’t be changing heights until I increase in strength which will take some time. My chief complaint is that one of the bars sits flat, no unsteadiness while the other bar is uneven and shakes. I put a shim underneath to even it out so I made it work for me. It’s a pain to take it apart, put it back and return for another that potentially will have the same manufacturing problem, so I’m just dealing with it. Other than that it seems solid and does the job. That’s my experience so far.","Reviewed in the United States on 7 November 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"453","Sunny Health & Fitness Twisting Stair Stepper Machine","Amazing product","Antonio s.","Antes de comprar el aparato he leido miles de reseñas de esta y otras maquinas parecidas, mi conclusion despues de 6 meses es el siguiente.Es una maquina que funciona con dos hidraulicos lo cual significa que estos tienen una vida util diferente al resto de la maquina, pero estos pueden ser reparados o remplazados, aunque por el pequeño precio que tiene la maquina en si no creo que valga la pena, para que estos hidraulicos funcionen bien y tengan una vida util larga es importante mantenerlos bien, lo mas importante es evitar que estos lleguen a calentarse mucho o esten en funcionamiento mucho tiempo a una temperatura alta, por dentro tienen un aceite especial que es la que se calienta y pierde sus propiedades, la mejor forma para que no se caliente es o utilizarlos en tramos cortos de unos 15 min y dejarlos enfriar o utilizar un sistema de enfriamiento para que no se caliente tanto, un sistema simple consistiria en un ventilador a la altura del suelo o ventilacion cruzada; ya sea cerca de una puerta al exterior o aire acondicionado en la estancia. En invierno o en un clima frio seria suficiente para que no se calentara tanto, aun asi sienpre es mejor usarlos periodos cortos 15 o 20 min y dejar que se enfrie. Si dejamos que se caliente mucho y lo hacemos de forma prolongada lo que sucedera es que el haceide pierda sus propiedades mas rapido de lo normal y el hidraulio deje de funcionar. Estos consejos es para que dure mas tiempo de ll que puede durar sin mantenimiento que ya es vastante, calculo que usandola cada dia 30 min su vida seria de 2 años como mucho.Teniendo en cuenta lo anterior evitaremos que nos salgan ruidos antes de lo normal.Y una vez dicho esto sobre la maquina para hacer ejercicios es muy buena, es una maquina muy basica y muy funcional, simula que subamos escalones, de echo notaremos presion en los musculos por encima de las rodillas tal cual como cuando subimos escaleras de forma continuada, un ejercicio por cierto muy completo ya que si se ejecuta bien se ejercita casi todo el cuerpo.He leido comentarios de que hay a personas  que no se les suve el nivel de pulsaciones, pues me cuesta mucho creer que sea asi, yo cuando llevo mas de 5 minutos noto que me cuesta respirar y que mi corazon aumenta sus latidos.Soy una prueba de que la maquina quema calorias pues a 800 calorias a lo largo de dia que uso la maquina en este periodo he perdido vasta te peso claro esta que intentando comer sano pero no deja de ser una maquina que puede remplazar una caminara.La maquina a los meses empieza a hacer ruido de sus hidraulicos pero no es muy molestoos ni nada malo es algo normal no deja de ser una maquina con un sistema mecanico, como el resto de maquinas que tambien lo hacen ya sea bicicletas cintas etc...Si quieres perder peso y o hacer ejercicio en casa esta es una maquina calidad precio efectiva.","Reviewed in Spain on 25 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"463","Sunny Health & Fitness Twisting Stair Stepper Machine","I'm pleasantly surprised!","Daniel Torres","Originally, I was browsing for a treadmill, but I really wanted something that would develop stronger muscles for walking uphill or step climbing (a few months ago I walked the length of the Grand Canyon,  rim to rim, and I want to stay in shape for the next trip). When I read the reviews for this piece of equipment, I was still slightly undecided about it, but I chose to take the risk.I've only had it for three days. I am 5' 11"", 205 lbs., and 69 years old.I had no problems putting it together; the base comes already assembled. The only assembly needed is with the vertical upright. I was very careful with the assembly instructions, and it took about 30 minutes to set up. But I went very slow. The equipment is made in China (imagine that!), so the instructions lack proper English, but they're manageable. The front of the base has a knob that will adjust the tension. The stepper makes very little noise; it's hardly noticeable.The base is approximately 18"" by 18"".Also, there's nothing to plug in.Before ordering, I thought that the handle would be too low for me, but it's the perfect height. I have mine set at optimum height (same as in the picture in the ad).Initially, I only took about 50 steps, and I was already breathing hard, so I got some rest. I felt that my leg muscles were receiving the exercise that I was looking for. Three days later, I'm doing 200 steps and then stopping. The air cylinders get pretty warm. I check the stepper every time I get off of it, looking for damage or anything loose. So far, everything is fine.I've also discovered an added bonus: I can place my hands on the bottom horizontal part of the handle (grip tighly) and slightly lean forward while stepping. As I take the steps, I slightly push up on my upper body with my arms, causing my biceps, triceps, and chest muscles to also get a workout, along with my legs. I just have to be careful not to lean forward too much, so I won't fall frontwards. So be very careful with this.As mentioned above, I've only had this equipment for three days. But so far, I am pleasantly surprised. Turns out that it was exactly what I wanted. And the price is very reasonable.UPDATE: I've had this stepper for almost 8 weeks. I have worked up to 3,000 steps a day. However, when I get near 700 steps, it begins to squeal. I've used different lubricating sprays, but the noise is still annoying. I finally found something that works: I place a small fan on the floor, directly in front of the red tension knob of the stepper. This cools down the bottom area, and that eliminates the noise.I'm still satisfied with the purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"465","Sunny Health & Fitness Twisting Stair Stepper Machine","Works well and easy to put together","Nat","Assembly of this is not as difficult as putting together an IKEA product, and they give you all the components to do so.  I was hesitant to buy after reading some of the reviews of the stepper failing after a few months. If it does, I will update the review, but it’s been a week and it works well.  One caveat: if you are a Canadian customer, you aren’t covered by the warranty.  The main handlebar and adjustment knob did not thread together, so I contacted Sunny customer support via email.  They always responded within 24 to 48 hours.  They shipped me replacement parts for free, but I did have to pay for shipping.  That was $55 CAD.  However, they told me that Amazon would likely cover that cost within 90 days of original purchase date.  I contacted Amazon support by phone, and they did refund me back on my original form of payment the shipping cost (without needing the invoice).  But, you only have 90 days to do that.  Even though two of the parts did not fit together (handlebars), I could use the machine until the replacement was sent, and it was an easy process to do it.  It would not deter me from buying another Sunny product in the future. Overall, I’m happy with the purchase.","Reviewed in Canada on 22 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"471","Sunny Health & Fitness Twisting Stair Stepper Machine","Where has this been all my life?","Marick","This is the most amazing little stepper machine. Manual instructions never make sense to me, but once I figured out where all the bolts went it was a breeze to assemble. I'm about 135 pounds/5'8"" tall and this machine has no problem remaining sturdy with about a 10 minute workout. I need core exercise or I suffer from sciatica real bad. I've only been using this stepper for a few days and already it has strengthened my lower back, and even sorted out a recurring issue I've had with my right knee for over 30 years. It does a great job tightening the muscles and is easy to use. I think with the ""twisting"" motion it somehow realigns the skeletal system, aiding in reducing aches and pains. I'd highly recommend this stepper to anyone who's been thinking about it, but not sure if they should spend the money on it or not. Worst case scenario, return it. Otherwise I think most people will be very happy with this equipment.","Reviewed in Canada on 23 February 2023","4.3 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"492","Sunny Health & Fitness Twisting Stair Stepper Machine","Great little machine with ONE small challenge","Info Seeker","I love this stepper!  The one ""complaint"" (and it is really just a precaution):  If you are weak (or perhaps elderly), do NOT depend on leaning on the handlebars to get on the machine - get one foot on first, then the handlebars will help you mount the machine; otherwise, it easily tilts and could throw you to the floor.  It is small, compact, easy to move and gives me a great workout.  I have a Cubii (can I say that?) and enjoy using it to keep my circulation strong, but it did nothing to help me build strength in my thighs to navigate stairs.  Perhaps they could add some weight on the ""front"" of the machine to counter-balance it, but then it wouldn't be as easy to move around.  I'd buy it again.  So many people don't understand how important it is as you age to keep the thigh muscles strong enough to lift you out of chairs, climb stairs, etc.  Having to pull (or push) yourself up a flight of stairs or out of a recliner with arm/shoulder muscles alone is asking for trouble - too easy to break or dislocate something - then what are you going to do?","Reviewed in the United States on 19 January 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

No concerns at all about them coming off when I'm working out. Not much else to say, really. If you need straps like these and you don't want to spend a lot, you should probably get them.One small word of caution though: they are not heavily padded, so if you weigh much, you may find these uncomfortable. I'm fairly light, so it's not a big issue, but for folks putting a lot of pressure on their arms, these may become painful.","Reviewed in the United States on 28 October 2014","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"511","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","Simple and Awesome","Ben S.","The pandemic taught me how to get a good workout at home, and even now that we're out of it the habit remains. This pull up bar is surprisingly durable and supports my weight without a problem (230lb), and it allows me to get some back work in whenever I want. I use only the parallel grips, as the regular grip is a little too narrow for my shoulder width, but that's what I prefer anyhow and I have no concerns about them breaking.I will say, it may be beneficial to put a tennis ball or something protective on each end of the bar that presses against the door frame, and it is starting to leave a visible indentation. But, that is also variable depending on the weight of the person using the bar and how hard it presses into the frame.","Reviewed in the United States on 6 December 2023","4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"515","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","A few adjustments as it did not fit the door frame.","Fulrcum","Seems sturdy. Easy to assemble, tad there are 4 screws and it comes with a wrench. And the metal tubes are pretty solid. When assembled it was too wide for the door way. I took off the rubber end caps and cut off 1.5 inches off each side and then put the rubber caps on again. Fits perfectly. I also wanted it higher so on the backside of the door frame I secured a piece of wood that boosts the bar up about 2.25 inches. This will also help with the weight (I’m 220lbs) on the moulding around the door. The only thing that puzzles me is that everything is metal but the bar that rests horizontally on the back of the door frame. It’s plastic. Seems somewhat durable, but I wonder if that will be the thing that might break. We will see.***Update (3 weeks later): solid and functional. I’ve done about 900 chin ups/pull ups on it, and it flexes, but it is sturdy and solid. The foam pads have ripped a bit, but I just use hockey tape and wrap the handles. No other issues.

"519","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","Mine came a little scuffed","Tadeo Eduardo","Mine was slated to come in 3 weeks but arrived only about 1/2 week after. Not a deal breaker, but when it finally arrived the package was crumpled, the bubble wrap was browning and the ziploc containing the screws was completely ripped. The tiny washers basically dropped out asap and I almost lost them. Foam was already dented in some areas, harmless but looks bad. Then during assembly I found out that the bottom screws were perfect but the top ones had too much leeway even with the given washers.I fixed it by putting extra 6.8mm washers to tighten the top area (as pictured). Unfortunately my door frame didn't suit the design of the bar and it hangs awkwardly at a 45 degree angle somewhat dangerously - at least it's still usable because of the horizontal bar being shorter than the doorway (2nd pic).As for the positives the metal is pretty sturdy, cushioning is just ok. My packaging looked like ancient warehouse goods but the product itself is fine. Ideally you want your door frame to hang about 2.4cm off a wall to get the bar to stand straight as intended, but even if it doesn't (like mine) it can still be used. Just exercise caution and don't swing on it.TL;DR Product seems fine, but delivery and condition leaves some to be desired.

It took 5 minutes (10 minutes max) to set the bar up and put onto the door. So far, there is no damage on the door and it is super easy to set up and take down. My husband is 6'0, 165lbs and I'm 4'11, 105lbs and both of us use the bar. We have toddlers running around the home so we constantly need the doors closed, which means we take the bar down daily and put it back up at night when they are sleeping. It is super easy to take on and off. I'm super happy we bought it. The only con to the bar is how bulky it is since we live in a small space and we constantly need the doors closed during the daytime. Aside from that, I would 100% recommend the product.","Reviewed in Canada on 24 August 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"525","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","Geniale Alternative zu Klemm-Türrecks","Kai","In meiner alten Wohnung hatte ich ein Türreck, welches man zwischen den Türrahmen verkeilt. Die Gumminoppen haben abgefärbt und die stetige Spannung ihre Spuren am Rahmen hinterlassen. Außerdem hat das Türreck doch auf Dauer auch gestört.Der Iron Gym ist eine geniale Alternative, sofern man einen Türrahmen im Haus hat, dessen Maße passen. Meiner hat eine Tiefe von 18,5 cm, das Gewicht hängt so allerdings schon an den Rundstangen, der Plastikteil liegt nicht mehr auf der Wand auf. Dennoch hält es mein Gewicht von 75 kg ohne Probleme. Also erst Ausmessen, dann Bestellen!Lieferung: Wie immer top und zügig durch Amazon.Verpackung: Alle Einzelteile sind sicher in Schaumstoff verpackt, Kleinteile getrennt. Im Lieferumfang enthalten sind der Iron Gym (bestehend aus 4 Stangen plus der Plastik/Schaumstoff Auflage), ein kleiner Ernähtungs- und Trainings-Ratgeber, ein Sicherheitskeil und die Sicherheits-Befestigung. Letztere sind beide optional und verhindern, dass der Iron Gym sich beim Training aushängt. Der Keil wird einfach in den Türrahmen gesteckt, die Befestigung wird mit Dübeln in der Wand verankert. Doch wie gesagt, beides optional, ich trainiere ohne.Qualität: Ich war überrascht, wie robust die Konstruktion wirkt. Die Schaumstoffpolster halten einiges aus, die Metallstangen sind allesamt solide und ohne scharfe Kanten. Die Montage ist eine Sache von Sekunden - statt dem beigepackten Schlüssel würde ich für die Schrauben aber eigenes Werkzeug empfehlen. Die Schrauben jedoch nicht zu fest ziehen!Handling: Klimmzüge müssen natürlich mit angewinkelten Beinen durchgeführt werden. Die Griffe sind angenehm und rutschfest, 3 Griffstellungen sind möglich. Auch für Liegestütze (2 Griffmöglichkeiten) und Sit-Ups ist das Gerät klasse. Für Dips ist ein Stuhl praktischer als dieses Gerät, da zu tief.Meine volle Kaufempfehlung. Sollte sich auf lange Zeit meine Meinung zum Iron Gym ändern, werde ich die Rezession natürlich dementsprechend aktualisieren.","Reviewed in Germany on 19 October 2012","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"539","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","Good Addition to an Iron Gym, Especially If You Like Velcro","Brett","Bought to use with my Iron Gym (duh) so that I could do hanging ab exercises.  They do work well enough, but I sometimes question if they will hold me (the closures on them are velcro - and while the contact area for the velcro pads is substantial, I still hesitated at first to put my full weight on them.  That said, they do hold (I'm about 175lbs) and don't seem to be straining at all but I'll knock off half a start for using velcro over a different hanging solution (not to mention the ripping sound of parting that much velcro when you remove them).They do enable me to do the hanging ab crunches I purchased them for, but not the oblique movements - this is not due to a fault in the product itself per se, but more just a fact of how it works - since you're hanging under the Iron Gym, you're in the middle of a door frame.  This means that side to side movements will be limited by the width of the door frame itself.  So half a star lost here.Still overall, a good product if you already own the Iron Gym (or similar) and want to expand your use of it.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 August 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"541","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","Very few flaws—well built","Anon","I purchased this for my twelve year old daughter, who wanted to strengthen her arms. Therefore, I never planned on doing any “heavy-duty” workouts with it or such, so I can’t properly rate it in regards to range of motion as I have no experience in that department, but it seems to be sturdy enough for dips, pushups, etc from what I can tell. In regards to the set-up, the instructions were a bit confusing, but there are many Youtube videos online easily guiding you through the process, so that was no problem.Everything was very well packaged and nothing was damaged-everything was in bags, that were indicated.Now in regards to the sturdiness. I’ll be honest, at first, I was a bit worried that it would fall. We hung it on my daughter’s doorframe, so it would be a pull-up bar. After pulling on it quite a few times to test the durability, we tried it. I believe the weight limit is something around 250lbs or so. I feel as if this bar would be sturdy enough, but I am not positive.Last two things—the only big flaw I noticed was that since we hung ours on the doorframe, we must be really careful to not push up when  when doing pull-ups as that would cause it to fall from the doorframe and for the person to injure themselves. Lastly, I read some reviews mentioning that the individual’s doorframe began to bend and the bar caused problems in the doorframe. Since I haven’t had it very long, and since the primary user of the bar is only around 80 lbs, I haven’t seen any issues in the doorframe, but only time will tell.Overall, I recommend this bar for recreational purposes, and just to get a good workout in at home. It serves our purpose and is very helpful.","Reviewed in the United States on 12 January 2020","4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"550","Iron Gym Pull Up Bars","NOT IRON GYM","RedFormula1","I had read the reviews before so I knew that the product was a FAKE. Surprisingly the product wasn't as bad as reviewed. It is a Door Gym not and Iron Gym, also I think the items are second hand, due to poor conditions.  I think the seller should be more honest about the product they are selling as it is deception.The item was poorly packaged (just in a large jiffy bag), and the main box was also damaged.It did arrive before estimated date. The item smells and feels new (just a 'knock-off' version). However the damaged instructions suggest the product maybe second hand. Some reviews have reported having difficulty fitting the Door Gym together. I didn't have this problem, all screws were present and fit the frame (just).The item fits inside my door frame and hold my weight. The pads are comfortable (one is a bit loose) and i feel safe using the product.  The main bar may prove to be weak as it is in two sections with nothing (not even a clips inside the bars) holding them together so your weight is resting on the plastic bar at the top. However, this is nothing a bit of duck tape can't strengthen.  , Box and Instructions damaged but efficient seller.Yes, the seller lied, deceived and has used 'fake' pictures of the item hey are selling, something you expect from eBay NOT Amazon.  The material is cheaper than the Iron Gym but as you are only a few feet from the ground I can't see any health risks. Also, it costs just over £10, what do you expect?! If you want amazing quality good then your going to have to pay top prices. There is a reason Gym's charge high monthly rates, and it is because their equipment is expensive! I'm afraid there is not such thing as a bargain anymore only expensive imitation and copy cat products.It suited my needs as it will not be over used but if you are a heavy male/female or intend to use this product intensely I suggest you purchase the real thing.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 December 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"556","INNOCEDAR Home Gym Bar Kit with Resistance Bands","Decent product, but not for people under 6’0”","Susan","This was, in my opinion, a great set for the prime day price with which  I bought it. The bar fits together perfectly, and it isn't too heavy but substantial enough. I don't know how well the rings on each end will hold up, because they're fastened onto the bar's ends, not screwed in as I expected. The quality of all the components seems fine!!My one comment is that the included straps are waaay too heavy for me to use. The product description was pretty much accurate, so I cannot say I was surprised. I was really hoping that this company would also offer different strengths of straps for purchase separately, or that a product would exist that otherwise fills this void. However, there isn't much at this time.Still, this set is an excellent idea! I'm getting lighter straps that hopefully will fit, and if the 30lb straps that are included are fine for you, this is an excellent way to try out this form of strength training for yourself. Particularly for prime day, this was an EXCELLENT value.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 July 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

But a lot of the exercises I can crank out 40+ reps with all 6 bands, and I’m not a muscular guy by any means.My recommendation to the seller: add shorter bands for your shorter clients, or at least offer them.","Reviewed in the United States on 7 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"560","INNOCEDAR Home Gym Bar Kit with Resistance Bands",NA,"Clive Carpenter","This ""home gym"" is much more than I expected. The bar is very robust amd seems to hold up to the instense resistance put on it between you and the bands. I REALLY appreciate the fact that the bands are covered by the nylon sleeves because, like most men, I HAVE BODY HAIR and there's nothing more uncomfortable than bare latex or rubber bands rubbing against your body and pulling your friggin hair. It's what has kept me from using the other band systems I've owned in the past. But the Innocedar bands are a huge relief and was the major reason I chose THIS system over the Redge Fit one. The 3-piece bar is another reason because it's wide enough to be.used comfortably for men with wide shoulders. And the price was the final deciding factor. With a good amount of resistance, the bands are great for people just getting into band fitness or those who are trying to get back into shape after years of not hitting the gym (like yours truly) and seeking a low-impact solution when time has caught up your joints. The Redge Fit system seems to be an okay product but for the price you're getting more with the Innocedar. Redge Fit does offer their app, but you can easily find great band workout vids and channels on YouTube for free. BUT... I've only been using this for a short time. I'll post a update if anything changes.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 August 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The two foot pedals are definitely a plus to have with this set.  Once your feet are in the pedal straps, they don’t slip out while doing your stretch routine.  I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  This is an outstanding movable gym that you can travel where ever you go that has a door to anchor the resistance bands.

I would stop using the band if I didn’t need all of the bands for a solid workout. Also you can’t do all of the exercises as displayed in the chart. There just isn’t enough resistance. For example, if you try to do the row exercise, there is still slack on the bands. I have work-around but if they show an exercise I shouldn’t have to figure out an alternative.

Ho propeso per queste per il prezzo (non sapendo se mi ci sarei trovato bene ho comprato le più economiche). Sono di buona fattura e sono ancora integre e non hanno perso resistenza. Ho notato solamente che in alcune si è impressa una piega esattamente a metà, dovuta probabilmente a un mio non corretto utilizzo, ma questa non ha compromesso le caratteristiche di base.

"762","Resistance Bands Set of 5 with Handle Strength Exercise Resistance Band","Ottimo prodotto per l'allenamento domestico","LORENZO","Ho acquistato questo set di elastici per aumentare sia di numero che di intensità gli esercizi che si possono fare in un ambiente domestico e le aspettative non sono state tradite.Il numero di esercizi che si possono fare con questo attrezzo è praticamente illimitato, proprio per questo motivo richiede un minimo di programmazione, sia per il tipo di esercizio che per il numero di elastici da usare, in modo tale da non perdere tempo durante l'attività fisica. Ma una volta trovati gli esercizi che si vogliono fare e trovato il numero giusto di elastici fa il suo lavoro. Un aspetto negativo, ma intrinseco nella natura fisica dell'elastico, è che la resistenza che offre cambia a seconda della tensione applicata e questo può risultare un po' scomodo in certi esercizi o anche per una migliore ripetibilità degli stessi.Nel complesso è un attrezzo che mi sento di consigliare, permette di fare tanti esercizi a un prezzo davvero basso, però non aspettatevi la resa o la comodità di una palestra.Per quanto riguarda questo specifico prodotto presenta alcuni componenti un po' cheap come le fascette e i moschettoni, ma al momento è solo una sensazione perchè non si è ancora rovinato nulla. Un secondo ancoraggio da porta/finestra sarebbe stato comodo per poter avere maggiore velocità nel cambio esercizio in un'unica sessione di allenamento (un ancoraggio basso e un altro alto sarebbe comodo) ma organizzandosi ce la si fa.Concludendo, per il prezzo al quale si può comprare, lo consiglio e ne sono soddisfatto.","Reviewed in Italy on 13 February 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Die Länge der Bänder passt für mich (168cm), die Griffe sind angenehm in der Hand. Das waren aber auch schon die Vorteile.Warum ich das Produkt nicht empfehlen kann und auch nicht mehr kaufen würde: Die Griffe sind für breitere Männerhände vermutlich zu schmal. Die Widerstandskraft ist so gering, dass die Bänder eher als Spielzeug anmuten denn als Sportgerät. Selbst das schwarze ""heavy"" lässt sich so mühelos dehnen, dass ich keinen Trainingseffekt daraus erkennen kann.Nimmt man alle Bänder zusammen entsteht ein Trainings-Widerstand, mit dem man leichte Übungen durchführen kann. Die Enden/Halterungen der Bänder sehen nicht sehr vertrauenswürdig und nicht lange haltbar aus.Der Versand war rasch, die Ware gut verpackt.Vom Produkt selbst bin ich jedoch enttäuscht und empfehle es nicht weiter, da kein/kaum Widerstands-Effekt.Das schreibe ich als mitteltrainierte Frau in den 50igern.","Reviewed in Germany on 24 September 2021","4.2 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"773","Resistance Bands Set of 5 with Handle Strength Exercise Resistance Band","Good for beginners and seniors","luciano","I bought these resistance bands for strength training as I am a senior and don't particularly want to join the lycra-lithe at the gym. The bands are graded from very light to heavy. I started on the lightest (yellow) but needed to grade up as it was too light but can see that the lightest would be great for someone recovering from an illness, etc. I then started on the red band and used that for some weeks before progressing to the blue band. However, I aim to stay with the blue for a while as they can be tremendously deceptive. You really don't feel as if you are making an impact but, believe me, you are. I have found them easy to use and very flexible and have been following an exercise regime on YouTube specifically designed for my age group. I do prefer the tubes with handles as they seem more stable and don't give you whipped buttocks like the bands do if they slip...... Yes, I have had that experience and it really hurts! I would recommend these for anyone thinking of starting out to getting fit and they seem to have received favourable reviews when comparing them against gym equipment.

"774","Resistance Bands Set of 5 with Handle Strength Exercise Resistance Band","The handles are poor quality","treehugger","Although I was using all 5 bands together for most exercises, I would have expected the plastic in the handles not too bend and split after a few months.I'm careul not to overstretch the bands themselves, so no damage to those so far, but it's tricky using these bands without one of the handles. I can still use the ankle straps as an alternative for multiple bands but they're not a great substitiute. For single band workouts, you can hold the band itself (the coloured rubber part).I think I'll try the ""loop"" bands.

Con il supporto di un video preso dal web ma anche dal libretto illustrativo al suo interno, do un approccio diverso all'esercizio fisico, non è più un corpo libero, non hai l'ingombro dei pesi e sono esercizi equilibrati in rapporto al tuo peso e alla forza che puoi metterci.All'interno ho trovato:5x elastici di diverse resistenze1x sacchetto per contenerle2x maniglie ergonomiche2x fasce con velcro1x gancio per bloccare le corde allo stipite della porte1x librettoLo consiglio assolutamente!","Reviewed in Italy on 16 April 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Übungen wie Rudern oder Pushdowns gehen damit problemlos, auch für Extrabelastung bei kniebeugen und Liegestützen kann man die Bänder verwenden.

"963","EZ Curl Bar - Heavy Weight Training Accessory Designed for Total Gym","This is what Bowflex should have invented","St8kout","Now I can finally do a decent incline bench press on my Bowflex Revolution. The alternative was to use the provided hand straps. When you put the Revo's arms down low there is no slack in the lines, so if you need to add a lot of weight you might need a spotter to lift the bar off the bench to slide under it, or buy more links to give you more slack. Of course, you could simply buy a weight bar/weights and use the Bowflex bench, but whatever.I checked the two end screws before using after seeing a review where one screw broke off. On mine, one screw was loose and could be turned by hand. I suspect that might have caused that screw to break off as reported by the other reviewer. So check yours before using.","Reviewed in the United States on 12 February 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"969","EZ Curl Bar - Heavy Weight Training Accessory Designed for Total Gym","Disappointed on design","Amazon Customer","As far as an easy bar, this product is fine, it'll do the job. However, after using this for less than a month, one side bolt that holds the carbineer in place pulled out of the threads. Understand I'm using this with a bowflex, so we aren't talking solid weight stress. Looking at the design, the bolt that holds the carabineer in place is not correct size. There is a shoulder on the bolt that should tighten up against the threaded insert inside the bar, allowing the carabineer to rotate on the shoulder freely, which would allow you to do the arc of a curl etc. But the carabineer is pinched between the bolt head and the easy bar, before the shoulder tightens against the threaded insert. When you pull the weight, there carabineer turns, which in turn rotates the bolt ever so slightly. After time, the bolt gets loose, then it pulled out. I had to rethread the bolt and the threaded insert, but it still is incorrect bolt. Only way I can make the shoulder of the bolt butt up against the threaded insert is too grind some of the easy bar off, allowing the bolt shoulder to reach the threaded insert. To much hassle for what it costs. I'm disappointed. This easy bar would have failed much sooner if I was using actual weight instead of a bowflex.","Reviewed in the United States on 6 March 2021","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1058","BCBIG Dumbbells Set","Relatively inexpensive but versatile introduction to Kettlebell.","Greg Bloom","I use the kb with 5 and 10 lb Olympic 2"" weight plates and cheap sand weights for various exercises from bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, OH presses, kb swings, Turkish get-ups etc, and so far I can't say one bad thing about this versatile KB.Pros-Strong metal cast-iron-Ergonomic / traditional-angled handle (great for wrists, eg especially holding it to the chest for Goblet squats)-Heavy duty weight and feel (can probably take a beating, but the threads could come loose over time if you do)-Easy twist pin allows relatively quick weight changes (30s-1min)Cons/recommendations-I would like the pin style to be modified so that you twist the whole bottom plate is the nut with a solid pin attached to the head/top of the kb. It could easily by modified so that there are finger holes to loosen the 'nut'/bottom plate with one hand, while holding the kb in the other arm. It would also allow you to use the kb without any fake weight spacers as the bottom plate would then attach to the pin via threads. Just a thought.I highly recommend this adjustable kettlebell.2 things that I thought I would also mention:1. It is smaller than expected. It seems the kb was designed to 'fit' 5 lb weight plates very well, but 10 lb plates are wider (sand) and can't hold as many as metal plates, and 10 lb metal plates are larger in diameter than the kb itself (see picture). Not that this should be an overall deterrent for anyone since a) you can still mix and match 5 and 10 lb plates of sand and/or metal either way and b) it is my own error for not measuring weight plates and looking at the dimensions/diameter of the kb before purchasing. Again, this is a non-issue for me, I was just a bit surprised to see that the kb diameter was much smaller than I expected.2. Though the ad states the KB is rated for only 40-45 lbs max, I have used 4x10lb metal plates w the KB bringing it to 65 lbs total without issue, well so far. The threads to the pin are relatively wide and the steel is strong, but I assume they've capped the max weight at 40-45lbs since they assume the threads will wear down significantly quicker with regular use wear and tear (ie putting the KBs down hard, vibration, etc) and could become loose enough to wriggle free. Thus reducing their likelihood of liability. I'll update the post if I notice quicker than expected loosening of the threads, but so far to date (2 weeks or use everyday) it seems to stay tight and strong.","Reviewed in Canada on 9 December 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1059","BCBIG Dumbbells Set","It is EXACTLY what you think it is.","EaglesIII","I think this is a good way for people who dislike gyms or live in remote areas to be introduced to Kettlebells. A lot of versatility in weight adjustment and it gives you a “feel” for Kettlebell exercises. Start with just the 20# weight (or add weight if you need to) on an easy program such as The Simple Six and go from there. An honest couple of months of use will have you determining if you want to make a further investment in regular Kettlebells.It’s not going to be perfect for quickly changing weights if that’s your thing and it definitely can’t be tossed around like regular Kettlebells (kind of an asset as it’ll encourage you to properly park your Kettlebell) but for the Kettlebell curious beginner on a restricted budget it can be a good start.BTW- you don’t need to go heavy right away to make gains.

I have ran with it at 44lbs (3x6lbs plates) and at every 200m or so the screw is loose by about 1/8 turn.

"1061","BCBIG Dumbbells Set","Must have","Mdub","This is a really great addition to a home gym when you want to incorporate kettlebell exercises without buying individual bells. The grip isn't super thick so I can grip it easily, it's quick to change the weight, and the diameter of the spacers allows you to use 5lbs CAP weight plates you can buy from a place like CT perfectly. The only thing is if you wanted to get to 50lbs total, you'd have to toss on a 10lbs plate that will make it wider than the spacers/5lbs and that might be awkward depending what you're doing. Otherwise it's extremely sturdy and doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart. I regularly use it at 30lbs for swings and feel confident in it.Finally, I don't understand why so many reviewers are surprised that this doesn't come with the weights to expand this to the max capacity. The description and multiple images for the product clearly show that it's a base of 20lbs with 0lbs spacers in between until you add separate weights. There's absolutely no way that you would be able to buy a 20-50lbs adjustable kettlebell with all the weight plates included for the price of this on Amazon. Buying individual kettlebells for each size would also be way more expensive than this adjustable one plus the plates. It's not the fault of the product that these reviewers aren't understanding that. I definitely think this is a great product.","Reviewed in Canada on 8 March 2021","4.3 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1062","BCBIG Dumbbells Set","Great product and value!","Jeff A","This is a great value if you have the right plates already available AND if you can start off at 20 lbs.  It will save you lots of money (and storage space) over buying individual kettlebells.  While the handle is only 15 lbs (just under 7 kg), it's a big jump (+32%) to put on the base to make it 20 lbs. This kettlebell plus 4 - 7.5 lb ""pancake"" plates gets you to the maximum of 50 lbs (23 kg).  However, I prefer about 10 percent jumps in weight, so I added in a combination of 1.25 (close to half kilo), 2.5 (just over a kilo), and 5 lb plates I had from my dumbbells with the 7.5s and that provides a 20-50 lb range (9-23 kg) in 1.25 or 2.5 lb increments (about same as half kilo to 1 kg jumps).  This gives you the versatility to have very small to very large jumps in weight load.  Finally, it is about as tall as a traditional 35 lb regular kettlebell, but the handle is a little more squared (although not as much as a competition kettlebell).  Also, how you stack the plates and plastic spacers will greatly affect the balance and feel.  Overall, I found this to be a great option when I just started to learn kettlebell exercises and needed lighter weights. I was then was able to inexpensively add weight to the same piece of equipment as my strength increased.","Reviewed in the United States on 28 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1063","BCBIG Dumbbells Set","Good, sturdy and versatile adjustable kettlebell option","Mark H.","Appreciate the sturdy handle and base. The handle is similar to regular kettlebells and is made of metal so it’ll be durable. The size of the kettlebell as it comes is on par with other kettlebells of similar weight.Yes, if you want to increase the weight beyond 20lbs by replacing some of the plastic spacers with regular 1” weight plates, then you have to buy those separately (as clearly stated in the ad!). One ramification of that - as individual weight plates will have different circumference depending on the weight, the assembled kettlebell’s shape will also change to be more oval.I went to a local fitness store and bought a couple of 5lbs plates and one 10lb plate (see pics). Unfortunately the 7.5lb plates were sold out. Width wise, the 5lb plate is about the exact circumference of the existing plastic spacers, and I suspect that the 7.5lb plate would be just slightly wider. The 10lb plate is wider so it’ll make the kettlebell wider at that point - but that is similar to regular kettlebells that have a ball shape; you just have to adjust your stance when doing swings as you normally would anyway.Overall, good piece for those of us with limited space at home and don’t have room (or money) to buy multiple kettlebells of different weights.","Reviewed in Canada on 18 February 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1072","BCBIG Dumbbells Set","Works with 1 inch plates you provide but...changing out stinks","Blues Player","I bought this device to try as my fixed KB collection was taking up too much space.  I had a pile of 1 inch hole / 10lb plates not being used so gave it a try.  Note, the little discs in the picture are just plastic spacers for when not loading > 20lbs.. The handle is 15 lbs and the base is 5lb so you have 20lbs with no additional plates.It does sit flat on the floor with no protrusion on the bottom...the part you secure is recessed.Main issue...changing plates sucks and mid workout double sucks. Let's say you are using 50lbs total and want to add a plate to make it 60lbs.  You have to stop your workout...flip it over...try and untighten the bottom...then balance it with the plates and discs slipping around...line up the holes while adding a plate...and retighten.  Too much time and effort.  Now your heart rate is down...you are cooling off.Second issue with this system...do not try to do cleans or racks with this. It is a totally different shape with 10 lb plates than a static, round KB.  Basically I use this for swings only where I do not plan on changing it out in between sets.  Using 5lb plates is not what I had in mind to get the weight I needed.Also, the piece that tightens on the bottom will not stay secured.  Your fingers will just fit in the recessed indent and finger right will not hold for long.  No issue with weights coming completely off or anything but the handle turns loose and weights may shift.  I tap the bottom piece with a hammer but it is plastic covered and causes damage.I plan to just load this with 50 or 60lbs total and leave it set up that way static all the time for 2 hand swings or goblet / sumo squats. Kind of defeats the purpose of why I bought it in the first place.The biggest pro was it did provide a way to organize and occasionally use my old 10 lb plates lying around.Update: Honestly, this is very limited in functionality and sits most of the time.  I did spot a kettlebe video series recently by Mark Wildman about Loading/ Unloading weight workout ( low to high positions) where I may finally get some more use from this.  I may try that workout.But overall,  I can not recommend this handle system item for purchase and would not buy again.","Reviewed in the United States on 13 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1077","BCBIG Dumbbells Set","Minimal space and versatile with it's adjustability!","Jose Aparicio","This adjustable kettlebell is great. The amount of space it takes up is minimal but because it's adjustable it provides you with great versatility.

"1079","BCBIG Dumbbells Set","Great value, easy to use","Stephanie","Not exactly ergonomic, but it'll get the job done.  I don't know why there are so many negative reviews about the lack of weight plates--the description clearly states that it comes only with spacer discs that can be replaced with standard weights, sold separately.  The discs/plates are easy to remove or add, and seem to stay sturdily.  At least, none have come flying off yet.  Being used to using regular kettlebells at the gym, having such a large handle when using relatively light weights is confusing to my muscle memory, but it's workable. The handle size is only really noticeable when doing swings--doesn't really matter when doing carries, goblet squats, DLs, etc.","Reviewed in the United States on 17 April 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It turns out that there are only three small spot welds that attach the triangular piece that holds the weights to the center axle.  IMO, there should be a screw to hold it securely.Regardless, it would be fixable if there was some way to buy a replacement part.  However, Amazon refuses to support the product after a year, and the manufacturer doesn't appear to offer support or even have a website.So although I liked it well enough when I first got it, I have to mark it down for flimsy construction in a key part and a lack of post-purchase support.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1182","Yes4All Interlocking Exercise Foam Mats","Average product that could have been better","Percy","All the mats came in good condition, nothing was damaged. Each piece interlocked with all the others with no issues. I bought these mats to set a small tactile boundary for when I'm doing VR fitness and for the most part, it works for my purposes. What areas could be improved? The first time I used it, I was barefoot and after my workout, my feet were black and a bit slippery so I guess whatever coating is on the mat transfers off. I have these mats on hardwood and the mats have no grip at all so I found the mat slipping a bit around the surface of the floor, which is unfortunate. I will have to apply some type of anti-traction material to the underside (maybe a few rubber nubbins) so that the mat slip doesn't happen (which could be very dangerous for VR).The price for 6 mats is also on the expensive side and knowing how the product functions now for my purposes, I think I would have been better off buying a couple of thicker yoga mats to avoid the slipping and because rolling up a yoga mat is much easier than locking/unlocking all the mat pieces again, since I store it under my couch when not in use.","Reviewed in Canada on 15 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1452","CDCASA Adjustable Dumbbells, 44 or 66 Lbs Weight Set","Far Cheaper than a curl bar","Amazon Customer","Overall this is a good product id recommend, I got it for 160 but I dont think I'd pay more than that.The Good- it is compact and looks very clean, the design is appealing and the foam cushion on the bar is just thick enough to not be a hindrance. Ive never had adjustable dumbbells before so being able to drop weight was nice, plus I took the plates on a nice ruck and they fit in my backpack well. It is also available in a time where workout equipment is overpriced and scarce.The Minor Bad Flaws-There is black paint on the side of the plates and after a month or so ive rubbed some spots clean with my outer knuckles.The dumbbell handles do not appear to be locked in place, but appear that they can be twisted on their individual metal bars. This hasn't been a problem yet, but if you took this thing apart every day I could definitely see the wear causing it to spin more out of place.The Big bad-This thing is a pain to put together and take apart, I dont use the dumbbell functions anymore as I have my own. Attaching the first dumbell to the center bar is easy, attaching the second is a much harder task. I'm pretty strong, screwing the second in requires you to hold it perfectly level and screw it in for about 30 seconds before it catches. You wouldn't think this would be that bad but there's no way to do this that isn't incredibly awkward, and twisting a 33 pound dumbell around while also holding it up one handed puts alot of strain on your wrist. I essentially leave the inside plates loaded, and load and unload the outside plates as needed. I think this is more a design flaw than anything and could be fixed by someone smarter than I.Overall its a good, clean looking product, if you're looking for 70lb barbell to do curls and bench with since the gyms are closed this is a good fit for you. You won't find a cheaper option thats actually of good build quality, at least I couldn't.","Reviewed in the United States on 28 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

🎥 review with audio commentary.Overall Take on the weight Set: The attached video shows the barbell to dumbbell conerversion. The rubber material used is nice and flexible for the grip. You are able to secure the weights in place by using bolts included. These are a great value.  It is great because it is so flexible.  You can quickly change between barbell and dumbbells. Rubber coating on weights is a nice touch. I recommend this to anyone who is trying to build their home gym in an economically efficient way as this product is features two essential weight lifting tools (barbell and dumbbell).Why it’s useful for MY at home gym:I already have a cable set this is a bit old but made its appearance again with everything that this year has brought (need to stay away from public gyms). Cable machines are so versatile and an amazing but extremely pricy addition to an at home gym - we were lucky and had an old one already. As grateful as I am for a cable machine it’s really important to use free weights because it forces you to use your core to stabilize the weight. I use barbell mode mostly for my leg days to do good mornings and RDLS and of course hip trusts. I like to use the dumbbell mode for arm days. Moves I used dumbbell mode for include bicep curls, flies, and for bench presses.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 November 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I could not return them without paying for shipping, which was $200, so I sat there and stewed over my purchase, cursing the heavens that a healthy workout indoors would require the inhalation of chemicals that would preserve a deceased elephant for thousands of years.I soaked all the weights in containers of baking soda, that worked a little, but what really had to happen was allow the sun’s UV plus several days of off-gassing to happen, but this was not the worst of it. The silly foam and plastic padded bars that are provided were the worst offenders of the toxic smells. These, I had no choice but to tightly seal with several passes of medical and/or electrical tape to conceal the vapors to a level that was not very easily detected by the nose (I’m sure a gas chromatograph would beg to differ).These weights and bars are just toxic and silly, stay away, and whatever you do, don’t ever think you’ll find anybody behind this product that is easily contacted or is accountable on a level of permissible human toxins in final products with good quality control, nope, get ready to feel like a lab rat.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1464","CDCASA Adjustable Dumbbells, 44 or 66 Lbs Weight Set","Not the most convenient but they work","LaLoren","This is not the most convenient setup. When changing the weight you have to unscrew the whole thing. Still, seeing as I might never view my gym in the same way post-Covid, it’s a way to vary the weight without buying separate dumbbells. My daughter keeps telling me I should buy the more expensive set we bought her, but it’s a lot of money for a set that goes up to 300 lbs, when 30 is about my limit. To avoid long breaks resetting the weights, you can break up your days, i.e., doing all the exercises you do with a lighter weight one day and all those with a heavier weight the next. Can do the same with dumbbell/barbell. I also change off with bands, tubes and loops to vary it a bit. But, let’s face it, short of spending a fortune on fully equipped at-home gym, nothing will ever be quite the same.","Reviewed in the United States on 20 August 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

For me, I do body pump.  I am always changing my weights for different muscle groups within a workout.  This bar works great, but you have to be very strategic in how you set it up for your warmup (lighter weights on interior) and the interchangeable weights on the exterior.  The twisties that hold the weights in place take a long time to untwist and retwist, I ended up buying $2 clamps on Amazon to help quickly remove weights and re-stack my bar between tracks as I believe a workout can be ineffective if you take forever to fidget with your weights.

If you are using just one set of weights then the rod sticks out and you need to be careful so you don't injure yourself on the face if you are trying to lift it overhead.  It can take up to 5 minutes if you need to change weights during a routine if you want to vary the resistance.  Otherwise they will work fine.

"1570","DMoose Weight Lifting Belt - Lifting Belt with Self-Lock System","Decent mid-range foam support belt.","OceanWave","I was exactly 34 inches around the mid section at the naval and the large size was a perfect fit. By perfect mean I had tightened it to it's max and it sat like it should - not too tight, not too snug. If I was 33 inches around, the belt would be too loose.Good for all around support for curls, shoulder presses and nothing too demanding on the lower back. I would recommend a larger, leather belt for heavy lifting, like deadlifts or anything involving serious weight.","Reviewed in Canada on 14 June 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The delivery was great but what was impressive was the actual product. The belt is spectacular. I ordered a size M for my 32 in. waist and the belt straps around perfectly.I went to the gym today after a week of my injury with the belt tightly strapped around my waist. The belt doesn't move when you workout and due to the sweat and keeps your spine in a proper position. It provided the perfect support I needed to lift weights. At this price, I doubt I would have found a better product.5/5 from my end. I look forward to more lifts using this belt.","Reviewed in Canada on 11 March 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

My only complaints are that the stiffness of the belt makes it difficult to pick up weights when they are on the ground, how difficult it is to do pushups while the belt is on, and the minor difficulty of getting the belt on properly.

I have lost weight since purchasing this belt and will be ordering a size smaller but i will stick to this brand for years to come.

Before I bought this, I was using a standard 4 inch leather belt. It worked well, but I lost weight and needed a smaller size. I've had chronic back issues in the past so I thought this would be a good choice since it was much wider and appears to support the lower back better. It doesn't. The wider belt supports more OF the lower back, but it does so by spreading out the same amount of pressure as a 4 inch belt, over a larger area. Physics is like that. For me the reduction in pressure does not work and my back has been bothering me since I started using it.","Reviewed in the United States on 20 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1636","Yes4All Barbell Foam Bar Pad - Barbell Squat Pad","Works great for heavy barbel squats, but moves around too much.","KetoJutsu","I use this for heavy barbel back squats (my working set is about 5 reps of 400 pounds). I was getting tired of bruised shoulders and cysts from squatting without any cushioning, so I found this. It does fit onto my standard sized 45 pound olympic barbell, but the main problem is that it won't stay put. It doesn't move from side to side exactly, but when I am squatting with it, it will slide and rotate on the barbell and sometimes rotate to where the opening of the squad pad meets my shoulder, causing the pad to slide out of the barbel. This actually can create a bit of a dangerous situation when in the middle of a heavy squat. I've managed to avoid this issue with a bit of practice and making sure to position the pad at a certain angle before each set to where it won't rotate into the opening, but I feel like there needs to be a better way to secure this to the barbell.This does work fairly well with some practice. It provides adequate cushioning - actually probably too much cushioning for heavy barbell squats to where the thickness of the pad causes me to have to adjust my form a bit. But it still works better than the towel method I was using before, and it's a much higher quality product that most other pads I've tried which just fall apart. I've found this product to be extremely durable.If this had slightly thinner cushioning and fit more securely onto the barbell, this would definitely be a 5/5.","Reviewed in the United States on 28 November 2018","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

But when you get them on, they stretch (10% spandex I believe).If you are a size 10-12 in women’s pants, a Large will fit.I think a size 8 could also take Large unless you like them snug, then get a M.If you are a thick-waisted 12, or a 14 in women’s pants, I would get XL.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 August 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It comes on/off the door in seconds, so we tend to remove it every evening (just in case it falls off - although it hasn't yet).My husband is 6ft tall and so he needs to curl his knees to use it (we have regular 8 or 9 ft ceilings - so that dictates how high off the ground our doorframe is). He doesn't enjoy it as much, but I get a lot of use out of it.I had an issue with the initial package I received - the were that were included were too short.

"1713","Ally Peaks Pull Up Bar for Doorway","will pull your door trim off","Eric Novak","can't do a real pull up with it or you'll rip your door trim off. You should not be putting weight on the horizontal bar, as that needs to be the fulcrum. By holding on to the horizontal bar, you're just pulling the whole system practically straight down so the top retaining bar just gets pulled down and rips off the top door trim. You can only put weight on the ends of the 2 curved posts sticking out in the ""neutral pull up"" in their image. Another horizontal bar would need to be added to the system to do a proper pull up and have it lever into the door frame properly.","Reviewed in Canada on 13 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1716","Ally Peaks Pull Up Bar for Doorway","Good value for money despite the 4 stars","Stef","I didn’t want to pay much for a door frame pull up bar, so the price of this item was really good. When I received it, it was easy to assemble, took me maybe 5 - 10 minutes.The bar itself once up does feel a bit flimsy but it’s worked so far and I’ve had it for a while now, like a few months and it’s holding up great still. Keep in mind I’m 65kg and my husband is about 75kg - so we aren’t super heavy, not sure how much weight it can handle but I’m sure the strength of the doorframe will also have a part to play.I also enjoy using all the extra bits that came with it, feels a bit cheap but when you’re on a budget this is great!","Reviewed in Canada on 16 February 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1718","Ally Peaks Pull Up Bar for Doorway","Overall good product; just a few small complaints","Allen Setzer","I like this bar, and it's held up well to a few months of use. The only things I'd say could be improved are that the rubber sleeves at the end which sit on the silicon pads have a tendency to ""walk"" down the bar during use if you use it on a door frame with any kind of taper or curve. I have to adjust them every time I use it. The foam grips have also started to deform a bit, which I'm not too surprised by. I might have to replace them at some point if they start tearing. The caps at the end of the bar also sometimes come out of their housing, but that doesn't really affect the structural integrity. Just a small quality thing I'd like to see improved.I would also like to mention though that I reached out to the manufacturer to ask if they sold extra silicon pads so I could use this bar in multiple locations without damage, and they sent me a whole pack of extras for free. So I really appreciate that.","Reviewed in the United States on 14 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1768","Arena Strength Booty Fabric Bands","So much better than thin plastic bands","RiWü","I've been using the traditional thin rubber workout bands for two years. I would often find youtube videos I liked working out to, but would give up on a consistent program due to how annoying the thin bands were. Especially when doing leg/glute workouts, they would roll up on me and become slightly painful to pull against. I wouldn't waste the time to readjust them for every move, so I'd just endure the discomfort. I just received these thick Arena bands and they are worlds better. They are super comfortable, even against my bare legs. I made it through an entire glute workout without them shifting or rolling up. I don't think it's even possible for these to roll up. They have a slightly grippy rubberized interior so that they stay in place. I specifically bought the wider straps for leg workouts. I noticed right away that they are harder to stretch than my former flimsy plastic bands. I used to do this particular workout with the heaviest weight band of my old set and it wasn't much resistance. I naturally thought I'd go straight for the heavy band in the Arena set... it is waay stronger than my old band. I used the lightest band in the Arena set and got a better workout than I was with the heaviest strength band in my old set. I don't think this means that you need to be ""advanced"" to buy the Arena set. I think it just means my old set was almost useless... it provided very little resistance. I was worried about paying $40+ for bands, thinking it may not be worth it, but I am instantly glad I did. These make my workout quicker (no adjusting needed) and more effective. They are comfortable (working out is already uncomfortable enough without adding in bad equipment, why not make it more comfortable where you can), and I can tell by the construction they will last. Very pleased. Sooo worth it. If you workout regularly you should definitely upgrade to these. And if you don't workout regularly, it might help to have better working, more comfortable equipment. It's definitely motivating to know I'll have a successful workout before I begin.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 July 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1775","Arena Strength Booty Fabric Bands","Very satisfied","Katie","I read a lot of reviews before purchasing these online, and I came across some bad reviews about the quality. I emailed the store to ask them what was up, and they responded very quickly explaining that they indeed had problems with their manufacturer, that it was really unfortunate for them, and ensured me that it has all been sorted. I decided to trust them and went for it, and have been very satisfied with the quality. I love that the bands are all the same size while increasing the tension, and the fabric aspect makes them really comfortable and doesn't tug on my clothes, skin, or little hairs. The grey band (lightest weight) probably gets the most use for me (and the widest stretch range since it's the lightest), and I have definitely noticed a bit of loosening over the months (hence the 4 stars). The others, however, are holding up great. I honestly use the workout guide that's included in the package every single time I use the bands, as a reference or to structure my workout for the day. It's really useful and even has accompanying youtube videos to better show the exercises. The first time I used them I was traveling, and the suggested routines in the book are seriously killer- I was actually sore the next day, which was really unexpected because I'm usually lifting heavy weights for my booty workouts when I'm not traveling. They include a week's worth of workouts for situations where you have access to a gym AND situations where you don't.

I've only had these for about 2 weeks and already seeing a massive improvement. I wanted to pay a little more for a better quality product. These don't feel like they're gonna snap anytime soon, sweat proof and don't roll!!! I'm currently using the lightest band to build up but I'm using it more for getting fit. Great addition to workouts especially if you're a beginner like me and have no clue what you're doing. You get a leaflet with exercise suggestions along with a workout plan and online video tutorials.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 August 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I did the Arena Strength for a few weeks, started with pink medium bands, loved the exercises & found them effective. I am now using the grey light band for full range of motion. I am growing stronger. I find the pink medium  band has a little give after using it for awhile. I am looking for lower abdominal exercises with bands - seen the few exercises online on the Arena Strength website, looking for more specifically for lower abs, and targeting lower back fat & muscle tone. I have used other exercises from other sites, and circling back see the value in these Arena Strength exercises for lower body. I really like Anna Donauer featured on the workout guide, and would like to see her demonstrate more of the exercises on the website.

"1796","Arena Strength Booty Fabric Bands","FANTASTIC CUSTOMER SERVICE!!","Susan88","I actually have two other brands of fabric type bands. One is a set of three, but #2 and #3 of the set are just smaller in diameter, NOT stronger.. I’m tall and a narrower band doesn’t even make the exercise possible to do in correct form. The other band I have I like, but it’s REALLY strong. I bought this set so I could have 3 strengths of bands all the SAME diameter. That’s FANTASTIC!! I use the weakest for some exercises like, donkey kicks, I’ve never been able to have my thigh horizontal to the floor, and foot flat horizontal to the ceiling during the repetitions. I use the middle band for the walking exercises. I haven’t made it to the strongest band yet.  The form used during booty workouts? Is EVERYTHING. No wonder I couldn’t feel the other workouts.Secondly, the book is FANTASTIC. I LOVE IT!! It’s thick, plastic coated pages. It gives you lists of exercises to do on several different days, and includes workouts to do at a gym with the bands. The excellent photographs are extremely high quality, you can see the EXACT form needed. I turn on my music, open my booklet, and do my exercises!! Sometimes exercise videos are annoying because they move too fast, you can’t tell if your form is correct, (which is EVERYTHING), or I need to do variations. I like doing the workouts by looking at a list, it reminds me of workouts at a gym. Although, I have done the Arena Strength 10 minute video and found it excellent, the model is positioned, so you can see how to do each exercise correctly, and the entire time, you also see her reflection in the mirror so you can tell exactly what she’s doing!!Now regarding customer service. I had a odd problem with my order. I found the email address for Arena Strength customer service on the booklet and emailed them with photos. Within a few hours? I had a personal email reply from one of the actual owners of the company!! (Two women own this company!) She was incredible, and fixed my issue IMMEDIATELY. It already was a fantastic program and product anyhow, this just made me a loyal customer.

A person can do a full workout with nothing but a kettlebell. Even those who make use of every machine in the gym can benefit from workouts with kettlebells.I had a devastating accident, then a ruptured gallbladder, so you can imagine my workout schedule was set back some. Because of that setback, I had to begin working out almost like a beginner again. One of the first things I bought for our home gym was this kettlebell. It's only five pounds (I'm ashamed to admit that), but five pounds is what I need to start with right now. I'll work up from there.This kettlebell is very well made. It's so well made that I think it might last forever, yet it's very reasonably priced. It works. I do a lot of different exercises with this kettlebell. Some kettlebell exercises engage every muscle in the body, and I want to be able to do them, even if it's only with a five-pounder.If you're just beginning to work out or are elderly or can't use more than a five-pound kettlebell right now, I really recommend this one.

"1878","Hawk Fitness Dip Belt with Chain","Good for moderate weight, if you know how to wear it.","Marcos Poot","This weight belt works well for weighted pullups, and for moderately heavy belt squats. If you're belt squatting more than about 300 pounds, go for a thicker belt and chain. The chain and caribiner are good enough below that. Stitching is good all around. There's two D-rings each with a carabiner, left and right. I wear the belt by attaching the chain to the left D-ring and carabiner at the 5th link (use more links if your waist is big). There's now a long and short end of chain hanging down on the left. Take the short end and attach it to the right D-ring and carabiner somewhere along the 5 links; like a belt buckle. Then take the long end and attach it to the right side D-link and carabiner. That loop now formed holds the weight, if you thread the chain through the weight first! Easy-peasy, and it doesn't fall off between sets.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 December 2021","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1882","Hawk Fitness Dip Belt with Chain","Wouldn't trust it for maximal weight, but for weighted hangboarding, it works fine","Michael Corey Munn","What I like: The belt is very wide and padded, making it very comfortable and effective to use. The belt quality is good, and I could see this belt working well for high-resistance activities.What I don't like: This chain hooks that connect the chain to the belt are pretty cheap and don't fully close sometimes. I have to sort of make sure that the hook has fully closed before doing my work which is annoying. The chain itself is pretty light, and a bit flimsy and though I don't need to use this much weight, I don't think I'd trust this with more than about 90 pounds.Overall, for the money, for what I needed it for, this was a good buy. I'll never end up hanging more than about 25-30 pounds from the belt and for that reason, I'm happy with my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on 19 March 2020","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I emailed the owner, my email got lost, but he eventually got back to me and replaced it at no charge. Didn't even ask me to send the first one back. The chain itself seems a bit weak and light, but I have confidence that I could hang 90lbs from my waist and have no issues. So it will feel lighter than the chains you're maybe used to (definitely the case for me), but that doesn't mean it can't do the job.Overall, yes, I would recommend it.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 February 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

My only minor complaint is that the chains don't slip through the D-ring very well.  The chains get caught on the D-ring as you pull them through.  I think it's either a flaw in the angle of the D-ring or the shape of the chain link, but either way, it's just a tad bit annoying.

"1941","RitFit Barbell Squat Pad, Advanced Neck & Shoulder Ergonomic Protective Pad","Bag ripped after only a little over a month of use.","Kaylee","The barbell pad, band, and straps work just fine. The reason I am giving the product two stars is because after only a little over a month of using it, the bag that holds everything ripped so bad that I can’t even use it anymore. It is very low quality and poorly made. The drawstring ripped first so I couldn’t close it, and then a few days later, the bag ripped on the bottom at the seam where the mesh and other fabric meet. I am not impressed and of course, it ripped right after the window for me to return the product so I can’t even get a replacement or my money back. I wouldn’t recommend this product unless you have another bag that you can put everything in. I only used the bag on leg day and only to carry the products that came with it.

"1961","SPRI Braided Xertube Resistance Bands","Surprisingly good set of bands","Bookworm","I wanted to get in some upper body resistance work, but I'm no spring chicken and after years of overuse my shoulders are not what they used to be, so I thought resistance bands would be better than free weights.  I ordered the red resistance level, which turned out to be absolutely perfect for me.  I will say that if you order this you should ALSO order a door adapter that hangs at the hinge of a door, which makes the band much more versatile.  I've been using this about 3 days a week.  Takes up NO room, unlike heavy free weights it's not something you're going to be stubbing a toe on or accidentally dropping and damaging something.  Unlike MOST resistance bands, I have no worries about this separating from the handle, which is apparently a thing with cheaper tubing bands with only one point of connection at the handle.  This is solidly made, and I expect to continue enjoying it for many years.UPDATE: AFTER USING the red band for years, I came back for the next level up, the blue band. Both are used every other day, both are flawless. Have recommended to everyone I know searching for bands.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 May 2019","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1965","SPRI Braided Xertube Resistance Bands","Highest resistance band I've come across","Jonathan Wells","With this nearly year-long quarantine, it was becoming clearer that I needed a heavier-resistance band from the ones I already have. I could still get a pretty good workout with some movements such as lateral raises and a couple others, but there are some movements were even the conventional ""heavy band"" is too easy. For example: squats, presses, rows, bicep curls and others.The description of the 4 woven bands for more resistance and durability sure seemed to make sense as I read it for this product. And now from using it a few weeks I can say that it fully delivered as I'd hoped. It's nice being able to feel a challenge again and that I'm actually getting work in some of the movements mentioned above. It is a lot of resistance, so some movements will still require an easier one. For example, unless you're super short, I doubt there's hardly anyone who could do reps of lateral raises with these. Fortunately, this one (purple band) is the heaviest and they do sell other bands with less resistance.The only reason it's missing all 5 stars is that the plastic part on the handle is slightly jagged. It may seem next to nothing at first, but on a couple movements - such as bicep curls, it's quite apparent and can be a bit irritating. Something perhaps the manufacturer could look into and then truly make these possible the best bands in market.","Reviewed in Canada on 31 January 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1969","SPRI Braided Xertube Resistance Bands","Good travel option","AK-NJ","I bought the heaviest version for a 2-week trip to Australia where I wouldn't have any access to a gym.  I like it much more than non-braided versions because I am not nearly as worried about the band breaking.  And the built-in handle is a plus over continuous loop ones (typically the style for heavier resistance).I did three main exercises with it: a seated row, a standing press and a squat so I could effectively work my whole body (even without attaching it to a door etc).  In all cases, I either stood feel shoulder width apart (press) on the band, more than shoulder width apart on the band (squat) or placed my feet spread widely apart on the band  (seated row).  This provided heavy resistance (I am 5'11"" as a frame of reference) for the standing press, moderate resistance for the row, and fairly light resistance for the squat.  So to me, I would say it's roughly the equivalent of working out with 50-55lbs dumbbells at least for these exercises.  For one arm exercises like curls, it is very easy to change the resistance by moving your foot that is anchoring the cable to ground either toward or away from the handle you are lifting.  When I did these three exercises in rapid sequence, it gives a decent circuit training/metabolic training effect.  I wouldn't want this to be my main training modality, but for a portable option, I think it's the best I have found (it's hard to work your pulling muscles without equipment).  I think it's also  particularly good option for older adults who wish to add some strength training to their regimen but aren't inclined to lift weights or go to a gym - as there is significant resistance but risk of injury is relatively low.  Overall pleased with the product given my expectations and needs.","Reviewed in the United States on 20 August 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1972","SPRI Braided Xertube Resistance Bands","Well made high quality bands. Leave a faint rubber scent on hands when new.","Vinayak Suley","These are fantastic for doing a pretty good and well rounded workout routine at home! Something to keep in mind also is that resistance bands differ from weights in a fundamental way since your muscles hold more tension at maximum extension; I feel that this gives me smoother movement and better form.I'm probably about as strong as the average desk worker who doesn't spend a ton of time in the gym, but does have some active hobbies. And I'm 5'6"" tall. With that in mind, I think the blue band gives me a good amount of resistance with room on both sides - to make things harder or easier by controlling the slack. If you are about the same strength level but much taller, you might consider a lighter band and use the same logic for other scenarios.As for these specific bands, they are good to look at and seem to be built well and with high quality materials. The only con is that the first few times they WILL make your hands smell like rubber...faintly.

The red is about 15lbs of resistance and the purple 25lbs, but one of the benefits of these bands is you can vary the resistance based on how short the cable is when you pull -- I usually use these as the equivalent of barbells or pulley type weight movements with my foot as the fulcrum. The variations of movement are limited only by your imagination and flexibility, but don't be foolish and try to attach to furniture or moving objects like doors.These are now a fixture in my luggage for fitness maintenance when traveling, along with the perfect pushup device.","Reviewed in the United States on 9 May 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I had been using the single tube bands.  Then one failed unexpectedly when I was pulling my arms back away from the door.  I landed on my back & head.  I switched to the 4 tube braided version.

I've worked up a great sweat using this band. I'm taking one star off because the handles could be a bit sturdier. But don't get me wrong, the plastic on them is THICK and I don't see the band coming undone.. ever. It's called taking care of your product, the 1 star poster complaining about the handles breaking when he let them slam into the wall must be a lunkhead.This band will get you toned... work out 30-40 minutes a day.

"1994","SPRI Braided Xertube Resistance Bands","Better than I expected","A. Allen","Had the band for about 4 months now and average a 4-5 day/week usage. It's been heavy enough resistance for bicep curls and shoulder raises when I brace it under my feet. Slightly lagging in resistance when I try back exercises by wrapping it around a pole or tree. But overall it provides great, stable resistance. Love the rotating hand grips so I can rotate my wrists when doing curls. No issues of the band snapping which is something I was worried about. I plan to order the next resistance level up.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 November 2018","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1996","SPRI Braided Xertube Resistance Bands","Better quality than expected","Brian","The braiding makes this nicer than most resistance bands I have tried. The strength seems about right for medium. I'm 5'11"" and 190lbs and lift semi regularly. I wanted to the band to rehab past shoulder injuries. I find it is more than long enough to hold one end on the ground with my foot and do shoulder exercises with either arm. Only downside if any would be that the handles are not a solid plastic triangle.  The anchor is plastic and the grip itself is nicely padded plastic, though very sturdy.  A mesh straps connect these parts by running through the hollow grip. This in no way compromises the strength of the device, it probably make it more durable. It does make it slightly more difficult to hold the band during certain exercises depending on the angle.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 February 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2052","NewMe Fitness Adjustable Kettlebell Handle for Use with Weight Plates","Best fitness product*****","Pat","It's sturdy, well made, and exactly what I was looking for to utilise my existing free weight plates and avoid purchasing multiple kettlebells. I prefer kettlebell deadlifts for my dodgy low back, and this is great because I can warm up light, then add more plates for working sets. I don't recall what it's rated to carry, but I can just fit 4 x 20kg plates on the shaft, so it's essentially replacing a wide variety of kettlebell weights at a lower cost.One downside of the design is that the shaft obviously needs to be long to accommodate weight plates and locking collars, but this makes the whole unit taller than most kettlebells at about 40cm in height, so unless you stand on blocks, you won't have the same depth of movement available before the unit contacts the floor. I cut a tennis ball and put it on the end of the shaft so it doesn't damage the floor, especially when it's loaded up.All things considered I'm very happy with it, and the unavoidable limitations of it's increased height are an acceptable trade-off against the cost of the multiple kettlebells it replaces.","Reviewed in Australia on 9 December 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2060","NewMe Fitness Adjustable Kettlebell Handle for Use with Weight Plates",NA,"Rafa","The construction is simple and solid, while fit and finish are little on the sloppy side of things. The chrome is solid, no flaking anywhere to be seen, even if it feels a little slick. It does let it work well for more dynamic movements. I find myself wishing the handle part was a little thicker, but It'll still do just fine.As others have mentioned, the pin does seem to hang pretty low and will hit the floor if you let it hang too low on some movements: I'm 6'4"" and even for me that seems to be an issue.The nuts supplied are the normal spinlock ones every other dumbell handle seems to have, and while they do their job of locking in the weight, they seem to work best if you lock them back to back (see pictures).I'll be modifying mine to accept a locking pin at the bottom by drilling a 3/8"" hole thru, that will let me load it with one extra plate while feeling safe that the plates can't rotate looseOverall happy with my purchase, since it'll hold as much weight as I can I can fit on it without causing durability issues, and very much securely so after modding the tip to accept a pin.

They are a great price and unlike others that cannot break since they are completely solid metal. I am leery of any kettlebell grip or kettlebell handle for weights that involves any plastic parts since that could fail which is why I bought this instead. It's great for heavy kettlebell rows, heavy gauntlet squats and for swings where you have one in each hand which is why I bought a second one. I would not recommend them for other kettlebell movements since it would be awkward with bulky weight plates and I am not that confident in the pair of twist on connectors in those movements since they can come lose while using them.

If the spinlock collars shift, as sometimes happens with spinlocks, the user will be aware that 1 spinlock collar has come off before 2 spinlock collars both come off allowing the weight plates to fall.

"2068","NewMe Fitness Adjustable Kettlebell Handle for Use with Weight Plates","Good Product, but not really 2"" Olympic Sized","Tony Temple","I have been in the market for an Olympic (2"") loadable kettlebell that doesn't cost an appendage or organ. I am not a fan of the options I had seen to this point. I was thrilled when I saw NewMeFitness had recently released a 2"" loading pin style kettlebell. This design made the most sense to me and the price point was just about perfect ($50). The only thing I did not like about the product from online viewing was they sent a spring clip with it to hold the weights down. No big deal I thought, I'll just use one of my Olympic collars and toss the spring, it is after all, a 2"" loading pin, right?Wrong. The loading pin is 1.88""/47.6mm (pictured). Why on earth did they not just use the Olympic standard? We are talking adding .1"" or 2.4mm to the diameter of the product here to make it fit all your normal Olympic equipment snug. The plates move around a bit more than they should (side to side) due to this sizing, and you are forced to use their spring collar to keep the weights down. I did message them about this and they appreciated my feedback and took it under consideration, but left it at that.Beyond my beef with the odd sizing, the finish is pretty cheap. I have done maybe a couple dozen swings with this and the paint is already chipping on it (pictured). The head and pin screw are all raw aluminum, so I would recommend you put some 3-in-1 Oil or something on it to make the joining of the 2 pieces less grinding.Beyond my few small squabbles with it, it works fine for most kettlebell moves I have tried thus far. I do like the locking level on the head that helps keep it secure when you screw it all the way down, nice touch in my opinion.I do very much like the design of this product, I still think it is the best budget one I have found thus far. I think this product could be MUCH better if they would just increase the diameter of the pin so you could use an Olympic collar and not their spring clip.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 October 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2072","NewMe Fitness Adjustable Kettlebell Handle for Use with Weight Plates","Low cost of entry into classic kettlebell training.","BURT JACKSON","I'm new to the Kettlebell exercise scene (coming from a traditional barbell/dumbbell & weight machine gym training back-round).Initially I just bought one of these adjustable Kettlebell handles in order to incorporate 1 & 2 handed KB swings as a supplement to my already existing home gym plan.After a short while of messing around with it though - I started to get hooked on the idea of classic kettlebell training in general (which is actually quite a bit different then traditional BB/DB & gym machine training programs).I then purchased a second handle just so I could start incorporating double kettlebell exercises.Assuming that you already have a decent collection of low profile weight plates - you really cant beat these quality KB handles.Adjustable handles like these are the way to go in my opinion in terms of versatility & cost of entry into classic kettlebell training.From the best that I can tell (so far) - these handles feel & work the same as a regular kettlebell does - with the exception of them standing a few inches taller (which is mostly a non-factor to me at this point).I did a loading experiment - & comfortably fit six 10 lb. & two 1.5 lb. plates on each handle - with collars = (70+ lbs. approximately in total - including the weight of the handle). This is more weight then I'll probably ever need for most any classic kettlebell exercise.You could even use higher weight denomination plates to load it up even heavier then that - but I think you'd run the risk of it being to bulky - which would be less then ideal.Lastly - I would advise purchasing/sourcing a supplemental clamping mechanism for these handles. I use a pair of flipped upside-down old school metal screw-head-lock vice-collars (anti-slip).These keep the weight plates extra secure - & also allow the loaded kettlebell handle(s) to sit balanced & flat on the ground.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"2073","NewMe Fitness Adjustable Kettlebell Handle for Use with Weight Plates","Perfect Solid solution for a crazy low price","Greg3","First of all, I liked (loved) the cheap cost of this solid steel kettlebell ""handle""!!  Unless you just MUST have an all in one, self-contained fancy adjustable kettlebell, with just a turn of a knob to quick change the weight, or you must have the best of the best, or bragging rights, or you do many drop sets, etc., then be frugal and safe you cash and get this! Some of these Adj. Kettlebell sell from$130 - $300 BUCKS!! And some have plenty of plastic parts. And plastic parts DO Break!!! Then you have an expensive Kettlebell Paper Weight!!This Solid Steel Handle does it ALL (for Me!!!)  Only thing is with snatches and some over the head movements could take some getting used to adapting to and mindfully adding smaller 5-10 plates only for comfort. A Kettlebell forearm/wrist Guard is a darn good idea anyway for even standard kettebell workouts that will save you from bruising and most discomfort!  But for swings, dead lifts, squats, and everything else in between, you can load this thing up with whatever plates you want to your heart's content! This beauty is not going to fail!There are some criticisms in the reviews and the even in the few YouTube reviews of this handle, as to the total length of the treaded bar plus handle being too long, (some reviewers stated 16+ inches). And it does indeed look long in the YT videos, ""BUT"" I just got mine a few days ago from AMAZON and the total exact length of mine is 14 inches long. Two inches is a big difference too, when swinging this thing around you head or doing swings when you are of the shorter statured variety!The handle is 8-1/4 O.D. inches in width, and 6-1/4 I.D. width. Plenty of room for my hands. Thickness of handle is of course then 1 inch.The AMAZON Website description states ""non-slip"" handle. It is anything but that!! This handle is shiny smooth chromed steel, and I would be careful swinging it in front of a mirror or window even with a full grip you get on it with the one inch thick handle!! Slippery is Slippery no matter what grip you have on it! Haven't tried chalk with it yet.  It can and does get slippery, especially when hands start to sweat a little with your body oils from you hands.Having some extra leftover Mebmik (AMAZON) rubber/silicone Grip Tape solved any problems of this handle becoming slippery. Once in a while it's a good idea to wipe off sweat and body oils from the grip tape with a little alcohol and paper towel, and it cleans that right up and it becomes super tacky again! And this grip tape lasts and lasts!!! AAMOF, I will be ordering more today just to have it around for future projects!! If you intend to do the full Kettlebell workout routines, then the cloth variety of Grip Tape would suit you better which helps with grip and comfort, but not tacky where your hands will stick to the handle more and you won't be able to swing the handle inside of your grip for snatches and the like!  Will also try one of the cloth grip tapes to experiment with!! I only for the time being had this extra silicone/rubber tape on hand!Hey SORRY about the Loooong *ss review. Just wanted to steer some of you in a good direction if your looking to save some money and don't care if you have the latest and greastest.And I guess I have way too much time on my hands and need to get a life!!!!Just sitting here staying out of trouble with that damn COVID and Rampant Crime still lurking out there!!!Best Regards and Good Luck to all!!!","Reviewed in the United States on 20 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

While there are other options that maybe more compact, the flexibility of using my Olympic plates to adjust weight is great.The diameter of the shaft where you add plates isn’t exactly 2” so the plates have wiggle room that can cause them to clatter a little. However, if you set the clamp tightly against the plates, it minimizes most motion, even with more dynamic motion like swings.It’s a little clunky to load and because of the extended length to accommodate plates, it can make certain exercises uncomfortable or challenging like when the weight rests against your arm in Turkish get ups.Overall, good value and compromise to save space and money in a home gym.","Reviewed in the United States on 5 November 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

When I do clean and press's on my right side it's fine, but when done on my left the weights spin the clamps loose. Not too big of a problem so long as you stay cognizant of it and don't allow it to get too loose. I've taken to using clamps from my dumbbells on it too, so I'll have literally five corkscrew clamps on this with 3 or 4 weight plates. That has limited it loosening up almost completely.

"2090","NewMe Fitness Adjustable Kettlebell Handle for Use with Weight Plates","Great adjustable kettlebell (and a tip if your collar is loosening!)","Kyle","Great kettlebell handle. I bought it mainly to do progressive goblet squats and swings. If you already own a collection of plates (I bought the 1 inch/standard model) it is much cheaper than buying multiple kettlebells, especially if you don't know what size you want. Compared to my other kettlebells the handle is thinner in diameter (about 1 inch vs 1.5 inches or so on the kettlebells) but about the same in terms of width side to side (fits between your legs the same on the swings, not sure how to phrase it), so you actually get more room on the inside of the handle to fit your hands. The welds are a little sloppy, but that is my biggest complaint.Since some people are complaining about it coming loose, here's a tip!If you have never used a spin lock dumbell before, the best way to lock the collar in place is to hand tighten the plates first. Then you put the kettlebell on its side and roll it counter clockwise (to the left if you are holding the handle towards you). The plates will roll and catch the spinlock. After about a 1/4 roll they will be locked tight. This holds everything tight for 100+ swings with no loosening. In fact I sometimes have to knock the collar loose because I can't get it loose by hand after doing this. You don't even have to use the second collar provided with this method!

You can't put the ""bell"" flat on the ground as it is not flat on the ground.3.

The program is very nicely written and explained throughly, type the link exactly as shown or it won’t work.

To put them on place them on the fold under your butt cheeks and make them tight enough that you’re able to perform movements but not too tight your legs become numb. I’m excited to see my results!

Außerdem muss ich sagen, dass dieser Bauchroller ihre Erwartungen vollständig übertroffen hat.Die erstklassige Qualität des Produkts war das erste, was mir auffiel. Der Bauchroller ist hochwertig verarbeitet und hat eine hohe Stabilität. Es fühlt sich robust und langlebig an, was mir Vertrauen gibt, dass es lange halten wird. Die Räder sind stabil und können auf verschiedenen Oberflächen sanft rollen.Die rutschfeste Oberfläche der Griffe ist ein weiterer großer Vorteil. Dies hilft mir, während des Trainings fest zu halten und meine Hände nicht abzurutschen. Dadurch kann ich mich voll und ganz auf die Übung konzentrieren, ohne mir Sorgen um meine Sicherheit machen zu müssen.Die mitgelieferte Knieauflage ist sehr gut gepolstert und sorgt für einen angenehmen Komfort während des Trainings. Bei ähnlichen Übungen hatte ich zuvor Knieschmerzen, aber diese Matte hat einen großen Unterschied gemacht. Ich kann ohne Probleme trainieren, da meine Knie gut geschützt sind.Der Amonax Bauchroller hat meine Erwartungen in Bezug auf die Leistung erfüllt. Das Rollen ist reibungslos und gleichmäßig, und ich fühle bei jeder Wiederholung eine intensive Belastung meiner Bauchmuskeln. Nach kurzer Zeit konnte ich meine Bauchmuskelkraft und -definition verbessern.Da der Bauchroller anpassbar ist, passt er sowohl Männern als auch Frauen. Die Schwierigkeitsstufe kann je nach Fitnessniveau angepasst werden, was es sowohl für Anfänger als auch für erfahrene Sportler geeignet macht.Zusammenfassend empfehle ich den Amonax Bauchroller wärmstens. Er ist hochwertig, bequem und ermöglicht effektives Training der Bauchmuskeln.

En mi caso las ruedas chirrían un montón, no se si es porque se montó de mala manera, pero no sería lo idóneo para quienes lo quieren usar  y no molestar a terceras personas.Por último, el precio está muy bien, pero si no quieres la alfombrilla que te viene (porque ya dispones de una en casa), hay otros rodillos más baratos que solo ofrecen el producto en sí, es decir lo que interesa (el rodillo), como puede ser el de Decathlon.","Reviewed in Spain on 20 August 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Or any exercise in public. It was really easy to put together and I think for the price it was pretty decent.DISLIKED:However, the resistance bands are pretty soft. What I mean by that is that there's not enough resistance when you use the bands.Now, I've never done Pilates before so I don't know if the bands or cables that they have on their machines are like this. Maybe someone else can answer that question.

"2262","MALOOW Portable Pilates Exercise Bar Kit with Adjustable Resistance Bands","I’m 6-1 and height wise this good for me but….not resistance wise","Portia James-McKnight","Update:To get better resistance I use BOTH bands and wrap them around each other 3 or 4 times.As stated in the title I am 6-1 so unlike everyone else under my height I didn’t have the problem with the bands being too long. However, like other reviews state the resistance wasn’t enough for me and did try with both bands and it sure didn’t feel like much at all. I know it’s not because I’ve been working out for a long time because at this point and time it’s been a week since I started anything! I know my strength isn’t “THAT” built up hahahaha.Pros:Easy to assembleGood for my tall selfCons:Not enough resistanceHard to disassemble…as pictured I tried.Pushed in the buttons couldn’t get it apart and tried to gently push back the pink foam only to tear it.

"2264","MALOOW Portable Pilates Exercise Bar Kit with Adjustable Resistance Bands","Great concept but poor execution","Shamiere Contant","I really wanted to like this product, because I was impressed upon opening it how heavy and sturdy the bar was. It’s really nicely made, but they really failed to oversee the resistance bands’ length. I’m 5’4 and they were way too light of a resistance. I tried tying knots on each band to create more resistance but it barely worked and is aesthetically not just a pretty look. I find the crossing the bands and putting it on the opposite foot creates a little bit more resistance, but overall I hate that I have to work around the product rather than work with it. Good price, good concept, just poor execution on the resistance bands. 5/10","Reviewed in the United States on 30 December 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2301","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer",NA,"Mr. P. D. Boulton","I all ready own an ATX ( bit like a Trx). However this is too bulky and damages doors. The Jungle gym is lighter, doesn't damage doors and the straps are a lot longer. So if you have to use a door like I do, you can reach all the way down to the floor to do a chest press. Compare that with the TRX or ATX  which you need to add extension straps. Also the grip part of the  handles has resistance which make workouts a little harder (in a good way ). Some suspension trainers have too loose a grip or just solid. The foot straps don't get in the way like some people have mentioned. The other thing which I find useful is that you can alter the distance of the anchors due to the straps being independent of one another.","Reviewed in Australia on 20 June 2020","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2311","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer","Fun, versatile, good price, make it as hard as you want","Mr. P. D. Boulton","This review is from: Lifeline USA Jungle Gym XTThe title says it:  You'll do suspension training because it's fun; the Jungle GYm XT is designed to be versatile; the price is half of the overhyped main competitor; and you can easily vary the exercises to kick your a** as much or little as you want. Something about people makes exercise more fun for us when WE'RE moving, not the weight, the stationary bike wheel, whatever. With the XT, it's just fun to swing around and be getting stronger and flexible and be working ALL your muscle groupls including your core. Good DVD and sheet included; then go online and easily find many dozens of new movements you didn't even know existed.The Jungle Gym XT itself is well planned and built, has better split design than the TRX (which is twice the price); has better footstraps; has more durable handgrips, has incredibly well-executed (and quick adjusting)cam locks to lengthen and shorten the straps. It's just a well thought-out and well-built product.  (I also bought the Lifeline wall-mount kit from Amazon for $24.50 (less than the competition) and that worked well to mount this to my exposed ceiling joists in the basement. It's a very good design, like the whole system.)My advice? Buy the Jungle Gym XT, it will motivate you! Start conservatively, make sure your muscles and joints can take it, stay safe; and then gradually work your way up in difficulty with all muscle groups -- including the core. And feel free to come up with movements you enjoy; that's part of the fun of this apparatus.Bottom line: I've been weight training almost 10 years, getting gradually stuck in a rut, and the XT has me excited to be exercising again. Can't give a much better recommendation than that.","Reviewed in Australia on 20 June 2020","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2322","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer","Jungle Gym XT","Chris B.","OverviewThe Jungle Gym XT is a versitile, portable, durable piece of equipment, it is good for home workouts and can be adapted to work with P90X style routines.Because you are working against gravity with your own body-weight you get a very natural workout that can be very challenging. The Jungle Gym XT could be used on it's own for a full body workout but through my experience works best when incorporated into an exercise routine with free weights, resistance bands, machines and other body-weight exercises.Pro's & Con's of the Jungle Gym XT-Pro-Extremely durable & well built-Pro-Compatible with resistance bands/free weights/body-weight exercises/P90X-Pro-Improves core strength & overall conditioning-Pro-Cheaper than other suspension trainers but just as good (or better)-Pro-Foot Loops are more easily accessible than other suspension trainers-Con-Portable but not as portable as TRX brand-Con-Does not come with a mounting kit, but a door frame/tree/pull-up bar/etc, would workThe Exercises-Core exercises such as knee tucks will work your core better than traditional crunches or sit ups because your legs are suspended as you control your bodies weight in motion. Or you could plant your feet on the ground and suspended your upper body  for oblique twists.-Leg exercises such as the 1 legged lunge or 1 legged squat are good, but you need balance and coordination and a basic level of fitness to perform. This is also a good warmup exercise for weight training exercises like squats and leg presses.-The hamstring curl is a good leg exercise that also works your core in addition to your hamstrings.-Back exercises such as rows and pull-ups work perfectly on the Jungle Gym XT and the possibilites are endless as you can change your hands position, your bodies elevation, and the width of the handles.-Chest exercises (and dips) are difficult on the Jungle Gym XT because you have to stabilize your body as you press up which is challenging but works the stablilizer muscles well. (If you cannot do push-ups off the ground I would not recommend the Jungle Gym XT pushups as they are more difficult).-Both bicep curls and triceps extensions are great on the Jungle Gym XT, the closer you get to the ground the harder the exercise gets.-Shoulder pulls and rear deltoid lateral raises on the Jungle Gym XT are good exercises but I prefer resistance bands and dumbbells as it feels more natural. If you can work up to hand stand push-ups this is a serious shoulder building exercise but is not for the novice exerciser.In ConclusionThe Jungle Gym XT on it's own can get old quickly if you use it regularly on it's own, but when used in conjunction with other forms of exercise such as resistance training & cardio the Jungle Gym XT is a great way to enhance or add to a pre-existing workout. If you are just getting into fitness I would recommend purchasing resistance bands or dumbbells first as the skill level for the Jungle Gym XT is a little higher and the number of exercises that can be done with bands and dumbbells is a little more comprehensive.","Reviewed in Australia on 2 March 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I got scared buying trx online because of all the fakes. But i read on this one. I live it. We have a smith machine with bench and poulies. We put those on the bar of the smith machine. We have used it on doors but i feel that our hinges are not enough to handle our weight. We did go on vacation camping all summer and were disappointed because it soo hard finding a good anchor point. The trx probably beats this because it does not need to have parallel locations. Its one anchor point. So not really if you are in the woods. In the city easy!!  Any park will do.  I do love the ease of use. I did hate that no instructions other then a poster. Reallly!!!  I bought the trx app and did not regret it. So for the price i love it.  Does it work. Umm. Yes!!!!!  But not for befinners if u have no core strength at all. Be careful of some positions were u will bend overbend your back or stretch wrong ways. Its easy to lose balance.. if u use the trx app start level one and stay there all the way.  But this is true for any exercise using belts.  So all in all excellent buy. As serious as trx but way cheaper. Love the quality and feel.

"2332","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer","Great for the price overall","Chris B.","I bought this instead of the TRX which I use at our gym when it is available.  I didn't really want to pay the higher price for the TRX and also saw some positive reviews here and there for this.  Like most things, there are some pluses and minuses with this.On the plus side is the ability to spread the straps wide on the bar for different attack angles.  The handles are comfortable and the solid U shaped section makes getting your feet in and out a lot easier.  Like the TRX, adjustments of length are quick.  It does all the same functions as the TRX so the workout is equal.On the minus are first, the straps have no identifying markings to set the length to so it isn't always exactly the same.  If you're not anal, simply moving your body off to one side or the other just slightly evens out things as far as your hand position.  It's not exactly rocket science to get it close so that you're not directly under one and the other is at a 45 to you.  But since I like convenience, I laid them on the garage floor fully extended and used a template to spray paint small dots every foot and that works perfect and wasn't hard to do.  The second was that unlike the TRX that has a nice little looped thing to slide along and hold the excess strap not needed for tension, this does not have a nice system of what to do with the excess strap from dangling.  It really isn't horrible as far as in the way when it dangles.  The rubbery slide clips they give you don't work well at all and make it worse.  I just bought 2 little plastic clip-on clamps (the black ones with red rubber clip you squeeze together with your finger tips) and after I adjust the length, I just clip it up as high as I can to hold the excess and all is well.But considering I paid about 40% the price of a TRX, I consider this a better overall system that works great in my basement.  I love the quick, simple, and yet effective workout I can do with it.  It is a nice supplement to rest of my strength training with minimal equipment required.  Just move the feet positioning and change the resistance.  The wall chart is crappy, but there's a ton of online videos that are excellent.","Reviewed in Australia on 2 March 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2335","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer","Very versatile, great core workout","Cbah","I went back and forth deciding between a TRX and the Jungle Gym, and the reviews/ratings on Amazon and other sites pointed pretty directly at Jungle Gym.  The independent mounting of each strap allows for multiple positions, and since I mounted mine on a pull up bar, keeps them out of the way.  Adjustment clips are very secure and easy to match lengths on each strap.  I didn't rate durability as I have only been using them for 2 months but they seem to be pretty bulletproof.  I am most happy though, with the core workout while working muscle groups.  Push ups in the handles or lunges with a foot in the strap is an eye opener on how much work 'Body weight only' exercises can be.  Do yourself a favor and buy this, even as just an addition to your other tools.","Reviewed in Canada on 5 January 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"2336","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer","Awesome...Better than TRX","Customer","I was looking for a less expensive option to TRX. I was a little apprehensive but I am very happy I went for this one. Its not only cheaper but I like it much more. It is extremely well made, easier to adjust than TRX and more versatile. They can easily set up in just about any doorway, chin up bar, playground equipment or just about anywhere. The foot straps are great and easy to use because they stay open.  I'm 275 lbs and this will support my full weight on a single strap.the only con:The only minor thing I dont like is while using the connector piece to use the 2 straps as one, to throw over a tree branch or soemthing similar. While doing this you cant pull on individual straps. They need to both be used at the same time. Something can definitely be rigged up to make it work but it doesn't come with anything, this can be done with TRX, but overall this system is more versatile and easier to use.If you've never done suspension training its a great supplement to your routine or a good workout you can bring anywhere.

I do not use any kind of wall anchor or free-standing apparatus, I simply anchor this to the top of the door as advertised. I was skeptical, thinking that I would hear something cracking and have to have a long awkward conversation with my landlord about what I was doing with the door. Thankfully, everything is fine. It's quite surprising, actually. Using these for 45 degree pullups is my favorite movement, and adjusting the length is so fast that it's almost instant. The buckle mechanism is fantastic.

"2340","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer","Can't Go Wrong with the Lifeline Jungle GYM XT","Rory Scott","This is a great product.  I've used the TRX system, and prefer the Lifeline Jungle Gym XT.  It is more versatile since the straps aren't connected.  It is also easier to slip your feet into the foot cradles.  The straps also feel more solid on the Jungle GYM system, and the inline adjustment buckles are easier to use than the TRX system.  I used this while on vacation in Waikiki, I found some pull up bars at Fort Derussy that I attached Jungle Gym XT to, and ran through various exercises.  Prior to my vacation, I tried the Jungle Gym XT using a room door, and the entry door to the garage.  The system and door help up very well.  I was initially skeptical that you could use this system on the lighter doors  they use for bedroom, but it held up very well. To get the most of your Jungle Gym XT, I would recommend a pull up bar mount, or ceiling mount when using these.  Some of the exercises work better if you are right under the straps, also gives you additional resistance.  For the price, and the versatility, you are better off with this system than the TRX system.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 February 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"2341","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer","Please remake this with more versatile, rotating handles.. Update: simple mod can fix the rotating issue, but do so with caution","Mr. P. D. Boulton","UPDATE 2/25/2015still using the jungle gym and its pretty much brand new. definitely top notch construction. noticed my original review was unnecessarily long so here's a quick summary of basically everything i mentioned:Short Version:Pros:Device is much better Value than overpriced TRXStudy constructionDual Anchor System is actually better than single anchor IMO, plus you can make it a single with the attachment or bringing the straps closer together so it gives the best of both worlds.Cons:Handle is very stiff and doesn't rotate like TRX.if you use dry erase markers, try rotating the cap around. the handles are basically like that out of the box: tight fitting plastic on plasticthis limits ability to do some exercises to full Range of Motion like reverse flys, bicep curls at least for me (idk maybe i'm using it wrong)Minor Nitpicking: handle has no lateral or side to side play like TRX b/c of foot cradles. TRX has no foot cradles so nylon webbing moves through handle freely from side to side. (see pictures of both if this doesn't make sense)Easy Fix: pop out the handle and  sand down the inner pipe (DON'T OVERSAND or it'll pop out too easily).Bottomline: I would buy it again simply b/c the TRX is so overpriced ($200), but apart from that this device is good on its own merits and its really well built. Plus any minor issues can be fixed very easily (100 grit sand paper or sandinng block)Original Review (aka long version):For the price and compared to the TRX it is a good buy. My only complaint is that I would prefer if they made the handles freely rotate so you can use the device more easily when doing reverse flys, supermans, and other exercises which benefit from a rotating handle. It just feels awkward when you are doing reverse fly exercise and the handle doesn't rotate with you which could encourage you to unnaturally curl your wrist when you reach the end range of that motion. Although to be technically accurate they do rotate as it is just an inner and outer plastic pipe, its just not smooth enough to be functional (think extremely tight fitting plastic on plastic). Smoothly rotating handles would be nice for doing preacher curls or other bicep curling exercises which are really not feasible with the fixed handles on the Lifeline. Granted you can modify the product by popping off the sides of each handle which are part of the foot cradle and perhaps sand/polish it down and use a plastic safe grease like white lithium or silicone. Tried just the grease by itself but you need more clearance between the outer and inner tubes, hence the sanding.The other two things I wish they could have done was to make it possible to adjust the angle of the handles. What I mean by this is that if you look at the typical workout handle such as the TRX, they are just a piece of foam wrapped pvc pipe with nylon webbing running through it so you can move the handle laterally. The lifeline is essentially this but after the handles it is locked into place because the webbing passes out the handle and then makes a 90 deg turn through a narrow channel that is the side of the foot cradle and out a small slit at the end. This added friction from the foot cradle assembly keeps the handle from moving side to side or tilting, rather, 10,15 degrees left and right. While not applicable to all exercises there are certain ones where it would be nice to have some side to side play. However, this may have been an engineering compromise due to the need for stable fixed handles in certain exercises plus the incorporation of the foot cradle.This is for those who are new to suspension training like myself. The new foot cradle is a good feature, but if you are doing ab exercises like mountain climbers you need shoes otherwise the cradle puts uncomfortable stress on your instep or top part of your foot. Lastly if you plan on using this as a strictly door mounted device, i.e. no pullup bar, keep in mind there are certain exercises which you cannot do as effectively such as the mountain climbers since the backwards motion is somewhat blocked by the door preventing full range of motion. Of course if you are a seasoned suspension trainer than you probably already know this.However, I would still recommend the product as it is far less expensive than the TRX and despite the few nit picks here and there it is a very functional device***UPDATE*** I had previously recommended sanding down/lubing the inner tube that slides into the handle. However, after re-examining the handle which I had greased with white lithium I noticed the foot cradle pops out too easily from the handle so the combination of sanding and grease may make it worse as the cradle could potentially pop in and out inadvertently during advanced/high resistance body weight exercises.***UPDATE***11/03/2013 I got rid of the grease and very lightly sanded some of the raised nibs  and the handles rotate very well now. Just don't sand very aggressively. Sand a little, wipe clean and check the fit to make sure it has just enough friction for it to rotate without popping out. If you sand too much (i would advise against using a dremel)you could end up having the sides pop out on certain exercises. Maybe use 150-200 grit to start off and smooth it down with 400 grit. sanding block would be easier than sand paper since it is round so you would have to awkwardly wrap a piece of sandpaper around the male end of the handle and try to shimmy the sandpaper around its cylindrical frame. Its doable but a little frustrating. The only thing I wish for now is if it has more side to side play.  also the instep issue with the foot cradle I mentioned earlier doesn't bother me as much now so it may be a temporary thing once your body acclimates. Anyway on a legal note, these are just my observations.***I am not suggesting or promoting that anyone actually does this to their handles. It just so happens that this particular modification enhances the product's functionality for my own uses. Please  consult the manufacturer as they may have a more appropriate resolution for your particular issue.","Reviewed in Australia on 20 June 2020","4.6 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The Lifeline suspension trainer has split anchors, which allows me to position the straps much wider. This wider positioning allows me to do wide-grip inverted rows, which are fantastic for building strength in my back. The TRX suspension trainer only has a single anchor point, which does not allow me to wide-grip inverted rows. Other than that, the TRX straps are just as good as the Lifeline straps. However, I do think the TRX straps are a cooler looking color (bright yellow like the sun) than the Lifeline straps (stop sign red).

"2344","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer","hard to beat at the price","Eli","I own this and a TRX.  My biggest complaint with the TRX is how it has about 6 inches of play right to left side . . . while this is done in order to make it easier not to be perfectly  symmetrical when you setup before an exercise, that is not worth the downsides in my mind.  The biggest downside of TRX is switching to single handle.  Is it that hard . . . not really . . . but it seems a waste to do it that way and if you are doing something like consecutive different moves on with tabata timing, it is a huge pain in the rear.The footstrap part of the handle makes MOST foot based moves SO MUCH better.  I say most as lets say you are doing normal planks and then quickly switching to reverse planks, with the TRX you swing a foot over the other and your feet rotate in the handles.  This does not work very well on XT.  This minor downside is not that big of a deal and the upside is HUGE.  Way too many times I waste time with my foot getting into bad spots with the TRX . . . and spending so much effort focusing on the foot and not the actual exercise.This is also much cheaper.It does not feel as well built as TRX.  The part of the handle that rotates does not rotate nearly as well as TRX.  The buckles and strap of the TRX feel better made . . . but in reality nylon straps that are $10 can tow a car.  I have no fear either model would break.I do most all my suspension training with a single anchor as I have mounted one on my basement ceiling.  the connectors for the XT require a big loop to go through, which will be a problem for some anchors.  I do not feel the need to mount a second anchor to do some of the mid or wide stuff with the XT.  To me, one of the biggest upsides of suspension training is the stability needed due to single anchor.  Moving these straps out to shoulder width apart and doing push ups seems less efficient.","Reviewed in the United States on 12 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"2345","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer","Useful for travellers","Charles Norman","The LifelineUSA XT Jungle Gym is a very high quality product, built of extremely good materials. I bought it primarily for use while travelling, and for this it is very good. The integrated door anchors are sturdy, and rubber coated, so they do not scratch. Two separate ""arms"" allow for use similar to other suspension trainers (single point of suspension) or wider suspension points, which I find provides better workout flexibility, The integrated foot loops are very easy to use compared to other suspension trainers. They do, however, make it more difficult to pack the product into a suitcase, as they do not fold flat.The ""tree branch"" extension was something I did not appreciate at first, until I stayed in a hotel during very nice weather and was able to use their park-like back garden to work out - made for a very nice change of environment from the usual hotel room or gym. I suppose this could also be done with some of the other suspension trainers.Overall, I give it an 8 out of 10 in terms of usability, practicality. The only reason it does not get a 10 from me is its relative bulky size compared to something like the TRX trainer, which folds up into a very small bag, but which offers only the single point suspension option. The variety of exercises that can be done using this product are quite wide. The only limitation is the space available in a hotel room - as the only door that is suitable to provide sufficient space is the front door... and this is often in a very cramped space that does not allow you to do many of the exercises. I have often used it in the hotel gym, attaching it to a pull-up bar or even a weight machine support structure.Using it with a hotel room front door does require some care - it's best and most stable when the anchors can be used from the opposite side of the door's opening direction, so your weight is suspended by the entire frame of the door. Using it in the other direction means that there is only the door lock suspending your weight. I recommend using a chair to block up the handle and provide additional support, and extending the ""arms"" to provide sufficient space for performing the exercises.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"2346","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer","A different take on the suspension trainer","Indygreg","I bought this as I wanted a suspension trainer and didn't want to spend twice as much for a TRX.  I'd never seen one in the flesh and now that I've had it for a while I can give some thoughts about the differences.I didn't see it at the time, but the loops of this model are solid. For some reason, I through they'd be cloth like the TRX.  They are not.  Now this isn't a bad thing in a lot of ways.  The large loops that you can see are made of a solid plastic, so you can slip your feet into them really easily.  The downside is that I find them quite heavy.  I was intending on travelling with this unit, but frankly, it's too heavy and bulky.I don't have a TRX to physically compare it with, but I can see that a TRX really was designed for travelling.  Lifeline has tried to put in all the extras, that TRX makes you pay for, i.e. both straps have integral large chunks of plastic which you use as stoppers when you slip the handles over the top of a door and close it.  TRX makes you pay for that as an optional extra.  What I see TRX has is a great unit for travelling.  Having it at one unit, with that large strap that you can wrap around just about anything and secure with the carabiner is frankly a better solution for that.  And it's more compact.Does this mean I don't like the XT?  Not at all, it just doesn't suit some types of usage. For the way I currently use it, i.e. at home in my garage, it's perfect. It has all the features of the TRX at half the price.  If I was to travel with it, as the primary motivation, I would have been disappointed, as it would have been too heavy, in my opinion.If you're looking for a quality home suspension trainer, that can do anything a TRX can, at half the price, this definitely suits.  If you're looking for a portable workout solution that packs small and light and can be easily put around just about anything, I would go with the TRX.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 February 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2348","Lifeline Jungle Gym Suspension Trainer","Make sure you can use it properly","Fabian","This is an updated (edited) version of my original reviewMy wife and I had been looking to add suspension training to our workout routine, and after reading reviews of the XT and the TRX, we decided on the XT.  Before buying, we had a major concern about using the product on a door.  In the fitness center in our apartment building, the only available doors open *into* the room (as opposed to closing into the door frame).  We were unsure whether the XT could be used safely on this side of the door (or whether our body weight would pull the door open and we'd fall on our faces).  I went on Lifeline USA's website (the maker of the XT), couldn't find an answer in the FAQs, so sent an email to their ""info"" address.  Long story short, which is that what I was told by the company (that the XT *can* be used on either side of the door), was in direct contradiction to what's written in the directions that come with the product (which is ""never use on the side of the door that opens toward you"").  Since I bought the product based on what I was told originally, it was basically a waste of time and effort to buy it, only to find out that I couldn't use it the way I intended.This is new...I contacted the person who made the original ""recommendation"" and he was very apologetic, and accommodating with returning the product directly to Lifeline so I wouldn't have to incur return shipping (which I would if I returned to Amazon).  My wife and I are disappointed, since we were looking forward to using the XT, but we don't want to risk our safety by attempting to use it in a way that wasn't intended.  It looks like a well made product, so I'll change my original p.o.'ed one star rating to three, because of the help with the return.  For future prospective XT purchasers, just make sure you're going to use it the way it's supposed to be used, which is on the outside of a door, so your weight would pull the door *into* the frame, and not potentially pulling the door open (and causing you to fall).","Reviewed in the United States on 23 July 2013","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They just fall down now, leaving big loops of strap that kind of get in the way and make adjusting the strap length between exercises somewhat clunky and frustrating. So, yeah. Three star rating.

In my home, there was no door that met safety specifications and had enough room, so we installed heavy duty ceiling brackets in a spot that was better suited to our needs.

However, it's spot-on for carpeted areas or over a yoga mat. Despite that minor gripe, I have seen and felt a remarkable enhancement in my workouts. For those keen on upping their abdominal exercise game, this is a 5-star recommendation!","Reviewed in Canada on 21 July 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2369","BalanceFrom Ab Mat Trainer Abdominal Machine","Great lumbar pad...definitely needs to be broken in though","Krysztoff","I have stage 2 spinal deterioration, so when I do ab excerices that involve laying flat on my back on the floor, I noticed it put some slight strain in my lumbar region.  So I decided that a support pad would be a good way to greater range of motion while taking away the strain.I picked this model as it was one of the cheapest I could find on Amazon (or anywhere for that matter).  While it does give great support, the pad is quite stiff.  For example, when I placed directly in the center of the small of my back, the pad was so rigid that it elevated my entire body off of the floor by about 1/2 inch or so.  This then made doing ab exercises almost impossible, as I'm still developing my ab strength.  So I had to play around with the positioning to find the right comfort level.  After repeated use, the seems to breaking in now, although it is still a bit stiff.This was the only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars.  That being said, considering the price point, this is still a very well made ab pad.  Not disappointed at all.","Reviewed in the United States on 2 August 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It’s sole purpose is to provide back support and it does just that. I have no issues with the firmness as that’s the whole reason I bought it. Mind you, I’m only doing at best 100 crunches a day on it. So I cannot attest to how it feels with intensive floor exercise. I will say that’s it’s loads better than the old rolled yoga mat I was using. It doesn’t slid around or out from under me (which was my main issue with just using the yoga mat 😏). No issues with packaging or product presentation. Ordered 12/31/20 and got 1/6/21, not too shabby.In conclusion, it was fairly priced, decent quality, and suits my intended purpose.

This piece of equipment has become a key part of my home workout routine, especially for strengthening my core.One of the standout features of this ab mat is its ergonomic design. The mat comfortably supports my lower back, allowing me to focus on my abs without the discomfort that can come from floor exercises. Whether I use the version with tailbone support or without, depending on my day's workout, I appreciate its versatility.The handle is another thoughtful addition. It's not just about the convenience of carrying the mat around, but it also aids in maintaining proper form during exercises. This feature is a big plus for someone keen on perfecting sit-ups and other core exercises.In terms of durability, the Yes4All Ab Mat holds up well. It's made of sturdy materials that have so far shown no signs of wear and tear despite regular use. This durability assures me that it will be a part of my fitness gear for a long time.However, there's room for improvement. While the mat is generally comfortable, I've noticed it can be stiff during longer workout sessions. More cushioning might make it more comfortable for extended use.In conclusion, the Yes4All Ab Mat is a valuable tool for anyone looking to enhance their core workouts at home. Its ergonomic design, sturdy build, and helpful handle make it a practical and effective choice. I'm happy to give it a solid four stars and recommend it to others seeking to strengthen their core muscles.","Reviewed in the United States on 5 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2427","Yes4All Ab Exercise Mat with Tailbone Protecting Pad","Wow, exactly what I wanted!","T. P Roberts","Well, I took a chance on this based on some reviews and the reasonable price. I bought one of those bars that you attach to the bottom of the door to hold your feet while doing situps. Situps have begun to hurt my tailbone if I'm just on bare floor or carpet, so I ordered this to try to address that. I wasn't expecting too much. Wow, it's perfect enough that it motivated me to write a review. First, it folds in half, making it easier to stick somewhere out of the way when you're not using it. Second, I couldn't really feel ANY pressure on my tailbone. And I'm a bigger guy. Much more support than a rubber foldup yoga mat. All I had to think about was executing the moves, not trying to avoid hurting my tailbone. Also...as a side benefit, I know fitness gurus have moved away from ""situps"" and more toward ""crunches."" The ""hump"" on this pad fits to the small of one's back and encourages you to stay maybe a hand's width off the floor, but you can lie down on it if you wanted your shoulders to touch the floor. Anyway, as I DID that, my lower back cracked (in a fantastic way--like a satisfying stretch). I sit at a desk, and this was a great feel for my lower back, which is not the easiest thing to crack or stretch.","Reviewed in the United States on 5 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

My back felt like just my spine on a hard floor. The first time I used this the only pain that crossed my mind was the good kind of muscles working. My back didn’t even cross my mind. Like some reviews said, it is kind of narrow so I don’t know how a man with a broad back would like it but for me (5’3, 130 lb. Pretty average build for height) it’s perfect.

"2455","Yes4All-1-inch-Weight-Plates-Dumbbells","Fine, But May Need to Expand Holes","Marie-France","I got these weights to use with a set of Yes4All dumbbells (PN ‎DL2Z) I purchased about 4 months prior. I needed just a bit more weight than the 52 lbs that came with the dumbbell sets for some exercises. Since these were advertised as 1"" weights, and so (I thought) were the ones that came with the dumbbell sets, and since they are from the same company, I assumed they would fit on the dumbbell bars just fine. As you've likely guessed by now, they did not. I had to ream out approximately 1-2mm of material from the holes in these plates for them to fit on the bars. For other ""standard"" 1"" bars, this may not be an issue, but it's definitely the case for the Yes4All dumbbell bars.Ultimately, it was a minor inconvenience for me. It took about 30 min per weight with a Dremel and carbide bit to ream out the holes so that they would fit. However many people probably don't have those kinds of tools at their disposal, so figured I'd give a heads-up.Other than that issue, the weights are just fine, and were the least expensive I could find on Amazon.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 January 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

There were no noticeable defects or damage to the neoprene coating. The coating does have a comfortable nonslip texture. The quality seems to be right on par w/the other varies manufactured lightweight neoprene coated dumbbells I own. These would be fine for all sizes of hands. If you have smaller hands, you will be able to grip & hold on to the dumbbells securely & comfortably.Thank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope you found it helpful.","Reviewed in the United States on 2 January 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

These are 4 lbs and just perfect for me right now! There was a choice of many colors, and I picked RED to not have them confused with the standard weight colors around... black, grey, etc. They are wonderfully non-slip and feel great in the hand.

These weights are only about $5 each.  I was surprised at how small these one pound weights are, but in a very good way.  They are the perfect size to hold one in each hand and still hang onto your keys, while walking or jogging. Plus if you need to throw something at an advancing Coyote or Raccoon; to stave off an attack while out there in the park, then these fit the bill.  You don't have to hope to find a rock,  because your carrying these in your hands already.Just enough weight to do some arm toning and not get pained muscles from carrying too much weight.

(Me: baseball player with torn rotator cuff injured while not playing baseball.) You don't have to be an athlete like me to benefit from using simple dumbbells like these as part of your injury healing regimen. Just ""listen"" to your injury, increasing the intensity and range of motion in your workouts slowly and gently.IMHO these dumbbells are a nice choice.

I previously ordered two other sets - one from Amazon and another from WalMart; both of those orders had to be returned because the grips were just too small to fit my man hands. Those other brands were obviously designed for tiny girl or gnome hands, not great big man hands like mine. And, yes the color is lovely. I will probably wrap the grips with some sort of fabric to prevent the hand surface from becoming dirty.
